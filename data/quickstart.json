    "text": "Prerequisites\n\nRust toolchain\nFollow the instructions on Rust Lang's installation page to install a complete Rust toolchain (v1.81 or newer) on your system. After installation, ensure you can access the programs rustup, rustc, and cargo from your preferred terminal application.\n\nVS Code\nWe recommend VSCode as the IDE of choice for its excellent Rust support, but feel free to use another text editor or IDE if you're comfortable with those.\n\nSome helpful VS Code extensions for Rust development:\n- rust-analyzer: Provides advanced features like smart code completion and on-the-fly error checks\n- Error Lens: Immediately highlights errors and warnings in your code\n- Even Better TOML: Improves syntax highlighting and other features for TOML files, often used in Rust projects\n- Dependi: Helps manage Rust crate versions directly from the editor\n\nDocker\nThe testnode we will use as well as some cargo stylus commands require Docker to operate.\n\nYou can download Docker from Docker's website.\n\nFoundry's Cast\nFoundry's Cast is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with your EVM contracts. You need to install the Foundry CLI to use Cast.\n\nNitro devnode\nStylus is available on Arbitrum Sepolia, but we'll use nitro devnode which has a pre-funded wallet saving us the effort of wallet provisioning or running out of tokens to send transactions.\n\nInstall your devnode:\ngit clone https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-devnode.git\ncd nitro-devnode\n\nLaunch your devnode:\n./run-dev-node.sh",

    "text": "cargo stylus is a CLI toolkit built to facilitate the development of Stylus contracts.\n\nIt is available as a plugin to the standard cargo tool used for developing Rust programs.\n\nInstalling cargo stylus\nIn your terminal, run:\n\ncargo install --force cargo-stylus\n\nAdd WASM (WebAssembly) as a build target for the specific Rust toolchain you are using. The below example sets your default Rust toolchain to 1.80 as well as adding the WASM build target:\n\nrustup default 1.80\nrustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.80\n\nYou can verify that cargo stylus is installed by running cargo stylus --help in your terminal, which will return a list of helpful commands, we will use some of them in this guide:\n\ncargo stylus --help returns:\nCargo command for developing Stylus projects\n\nUsage: cargo stylus <COMMAND>\n\nCommands:\n  new         Create a new Stylus project\n  init        Initializes a Stylus project in the current directory\n  export-abi  Export a Solidity ABI\n  activate    Activate an already deployed contract [aliases: a]\n  cache       Cache a contract using the Stylus CacheManager for Arbitrum chains\n  check       Check a contract [aliases: c]\n  deploy      Deploy a contract [aliases: d]\n  verify      Verify the deployment of a Stylus contract [aliases: v]\n  cgen        Generate c code bindings for a Stylus contract\n  replay      Replay a transaction in gdb [aliases: r]\n  trace       Trace a transaction [aliases: t]\n  help        Print this message or the help of the given command(s)\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help     Print help\n  -V, --version  Print version\n\nCreating a project\nLet's create our first Stylus project by running:\n\ncargo stylus new <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>\n\ncargo stylus new generates a starter template that implements a Rust version of the Solidity Counter smart contract example:\n\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;\n\ncontract Coutner {\n\n   uint count;\n\n  function setCount() public {\n    count = count + 1;\n  }\n\n  function getCount() view public returns(uint) {\n      return count;\n  }\n}\n\nAt this point, you can move on to the next step of this guide or develop your first Rust smart contract. Feel free to use the Stylus Rust SDK reference section as a starting point; it offers many examples to help you quickly familiarize yourself with Stylus.",
