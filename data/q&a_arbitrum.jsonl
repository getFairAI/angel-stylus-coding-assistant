{"question": "How long does it take for an assertion to be confirmed if it has not been challenged, and what is the significance of this delay in Arbitrum withdrawals?", "answer": "6.4 days; this delay affects Arbitrum withdrawals, which require a confirmed assertion on-chain to specify a blockhash."}
{"question": "What information is included in an assertion that needs to be posted on-chain, and what is the purpose of the 'history commitment' in this context?", "answer": "An assertion includes the child chain block hash, a history commitment combining hashes of the chain's intermediate state, the batch number, and the number of messages in the Arbitrum inbox; the history commitment serves as a Merkle-like data structure to efficiently verify the assertion."}
{"question": "What happens when a validator disagrees with an assertion posted on-chain?", "answer": "The validator can post the correct rival assertion to the invalid one it observed."}
{"question": "Why are overflow assertions not subject to the mandatory 1-hour delay between assertions?", "answer": "Because a single assertion only supports a maximum of 2^26 Arbitrum blocks since the previous assertion, and overflow assertions are needed to consume the rest of the blocks above this maximum."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of requiring a large upfront assertion bond in the Arbitrum network?", "answer": "To discourage malicious actors from attacking Arbitrum and spamming the network, as they will always lose challenges and their entire bond."}

{"question": "Can anyone open a subchallenge on an assertion without needing to be a bonder in the Rollup contract, and what is required to do so?", "answer": "Yes, anyone can open a subchallenge by posting a challenge bond and an edge claiming intent to start the challenge"}
{"question": "What is the fundamental nature of a challenge in the context of the Arbitrum chain and the BoLD protocol?", "answer": "A challenge is a fundamental disagreement about an assertion posted to the Arbitrum chain, where validators disagree about the blockhash at a certain block number"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of creating a Merkle tree with 2^26+1 leaves in the challenge process?", "answer": "To create a Merkle commitment out of the blocks between batch 5 and batch 10, allowing validators to narrow their disagreement to a single block using Merkle proofs."}
{"question": "What information is contained in the 'edge' data structure created by validators during the challenge process?", "answer": "The 'edge' data structure contains the start_hash, end_hash, merkle_root, and inclusion_proofs, which are used to prove the validity of the challenge."}
{"question": "How do validators iteratively narrow their disagreement to a single block during the challenge resolution process?", "answer": "Validators use Merkle proofs to bisect the Merkle root and create edges with their own history commitments to each half of the tree, allowing them to progressively narrow down the disagreement."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of a bisection move in the context of validators disagreeing on a history commitment?", "answer": "To narrow down a disagreement by splitting a history commitment in half, allowing validators to identify the exact hash they disagree with."}
{"question": "How does the number of steps of execution at which validators could disagree within a single Arbitrum block affect the bisection game?", "answer": "The large number of possible steps (2^42) makes it unreasonable to play the bisection game over all hashes, requiring an alternative approach such as subchallenges."}

{"question": "Why does my transaction revert with InvalidFEOpcode when using Foundry?", "answer": "Because Foundry and similar development tools do not support Arbitrum precompiles, which are likely being called in your transaction."}
{"question": "Why do I receive an 'intrinsic gas too low' error when sending a transaction even with a high gas price?", "answer": "Because you may not have set a high enough gas limit to pay for the L1 component of the transaction fees, which is a common issue in Arbitrum due to its 2-dimensional fee structure."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of ArbitrumInternalTxType transactions in the Arbitrum network?", "answer": "The purpose of ArbitrumInternalTxType transactions is to manage state updates such as the L1 base fee and block number, and to handle value transfers related to acknowledging batch postings and discarded retryable transactions."}
{"question": "How are ArbitrumInternalTxType transactions different from typical Ethereum transactions?", "answer": "ArbitrumInternalTxType transactions are distinct from typical Ethereum transactions because they are created by the ArbOS itself and are not triggered by an opcode within EVM execution, despite having an INVALID opcode."}
{"question": "What is the role of the ApplyInternalTxUpdate function in processing ArbitrumInternalTxType transactions?", "answer": "The ApplyInternalTxUpdate function is responsible for processing and updating the system's state based on cross-chain messages produced as receipts for batch postings, ensuring consistency and integrity across the Arbitrum network."}
{"question": "What happens to the escrowed call value if a retryable transaction cannot be successfully executed?", "answer": "The escrowed call value will be paid out to a specified `callValueRefundAddress` account."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of using the `invalid` callType parameter in value transfers associated with retryable transactions?", "answer": "The purpose is to enhance clarity and distinctiveness of this transaction type within the EVM ecosystem, denoting a straightforward value transfer from one account to another without invoking smart contract logic."}
{"question": "How are funds associated with each retryable transaction securely held until execution or refund?", "answer": "Each retryable transaction escrows its value in a unique vault specific to that transaction, ensuring secure holding of funds until successful execution or eventual refund."}
{"question": "What is the label given to pre-Nitro transactions by Nitro?", "answer": "ArbitrumLegacyTxType"}
{"question": "Why can some blocks have a total gas limit that exceeds the standard block gas limit of 32 million?", "answer": "Because the gasLimit field accounts for both execution gas and the correspondent gas limit of the L1 costs, which is practically unlimited."}

{"question": "What is the purpose of Arbitrum and how does it improve Ethereum?", "answer": "Arbitrum is a technology suite designed to improve Ethereum by providing cheaper and faster transactions, while maintaining the same security as Ethereum."}
{"question": "What are the limitations of Ethereum that Arbitrum Rollup solves?", "answer": "Ethereum can handle only about 20 to 40 transactions per second (TPS) for all users, leading to increased fees when it reaches this limit, which is solved by Arbitrum Rollup."}
{"question": "How do fraud proofs work in Arbitrum and what is their significance?", "answer": "Fraud proofs in Arbitrum work by allowing the parent chain (Ethereum) to investigate and confirm fraud, penalize the guilty party, and disregard invalid claims, which is a key feature that benefits from Ethereum's security."}
{"question": "How do fraud proofs work in the context of Arbitrum?", "answer": "Fraud proofs work by having validators make claims about the chain's state, dispute others' claims, and relying on at least one honest validator to keep the chain secure."}
{"question": "Who is responsible for performing fraud proofing in Arbitrum Rollup chains?", "answer": "Anyone can perform fraud proofing by running the open-source validator software and staking Ether if required, as long as they have access to the Ethereum network."}
{"question": "What is the role of validators in maintaining the security of Arbitrum Rollup chains?", "answer": "Validators help move the Arbitrum chain forward on the parent chain by making claims about the chain's state and disputing claims made by others, ensuring that the chain remains secure as long as there is at least one honest validator."}
{"question": "What is the condition for the network to stay secure?", "answer": "The network stays secure if there is at least one honest validator."}
{"question": "How do validators resolve disputes in the Arbitrum system?", "answer": "Validators engage in an interactive game, where they respond to each other in a call-and-response format, to narrow their disagreement to a single computational step that executes on the parent chain."}
{"question": "Why does using Arbitrum help lower user transaction costs?", "answer": "Arbitrum helps lower user transaction costs by processing transactions in batches, reducing the strain on the parent chain and saving on overhead costs compared to submitting each transaction individually."}
{"question": "How does Arbitrum reduce the amount of information that needs storing on the parent chain?", "answer": "Arbitrum reduces the amount of information by posting transaction data on the parent chain in a compressed format and only decompressing it within the child chain environment."}
{"question": "What is the basic process of how an Arbitrum chain works?", "answer": "An Arbitrum chain works by having users and contracts put messages into the inbox, which are then read and processed one at a time, updating the state of the chain and producing outputs."}
{"question": "How does execution work in an Arbitrum chain?", "answer": "Execution is deterministic, meaning that the contents of its inbox uniquely determine the chain's behavior, allowing any Arbitrum node to tell you the result of a transaction as soon as it gets put in the inbox."}
{"question": "How does Arbitrum ensure the correctness of its chain state and outputs?", "answer": "Arbitrum makes sure that the chain state and outputs are correct through a two-phase strategy of sequencing followed by deterministic execution."}
{"question": "What is the role of Geth in Nitro's design?", "answer": "Nitro supports Ethereum's data structures, formats, and virtual machine by compiling in the core code of the popular go-ethereum (Geth) Ethereum node software, ensuring a high degree of compatibility with Ethereum."}
{"question": "How does Nitro achieve separate execution from proving?", "answer": "Nitro takes the same source code and compiles it twice, once to native code for execution in a Nitro node (optimized for speed) and again to a separate format for use in proving (optimized for portability and security)."}
{"question": "What protocol does Nitro use to settle transactions to the parent Ethereum chain?", "answer": "Optimistic Rollup protocol"}
{"question": "Which platform pioneered the interactive fraud proofs used in Nitro's Optimistic Rollup protocol?", "answer": "Arbitrum"}

{"question": "What is the main purpose of the AnyTrust Protocol in the context of Arbitrum?", "answer": "The main purpose of the AnyTrust Protocol is to lower costs by accepting a mild trust assumption, specifically by relying on an external Data Availability Committee to store data and provide it on demand."}
{"question": "How does the AnyTrust Protocol ensure that at least one honest member of the Data Availability Committee will provide data when needed?", "answer": "The AnyTrust Protocol assumes that at least two members of the Committee are honest, and if N - 1 Committee members promise to provide access to some data, at least one of the promising parties must be honest, ensuring that the chain can properly function."}
{"question": "What information does a Keyset contain in the context of the AnyTrust Protocol?", "answer": "A Keyset contains the number of Committee members, the BLS public key for each Committee member, and the number of Committee signatures required for a transaction to be valid."}
{"question": "What information is contained in a Keyset?", "answer": "A Keyset contains the number of Committee members, a BLS public key for each Committee member, and the number of Committee signatures required."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of a Data Availability Certificate (DACert) in AnyTrust?", "answer": "A DACert constitutes proof that a block's data will be available from at least one honest Committee member until the expiration time, due to the 2-of-N trust assumption."}
{"question": "How does the Arbitrum post data blocks on the parent chain in ordinary (non-AnyTrust) Nitro?", "answer": "The Arbitrum posts data blocks on the parent chain as calldata, and the hashes of the data blocks are committed by the parent chain Inbox contract."}
{"question": "What are the two ways a sequencer can post a data block on the parent chain in AnyTrust?", "answer": "The sequencer can either post the full data or post a DACert proving availability of the data."}
{"question": "How does the child chain code verify the validity of a DACert, and what are the conditions for it to be considered valid?", "answer": "The child chain code verifies the validity of a DACert by checking that the number of signers is at least the number required by the Keyset, the aggregated signature is valid for the claimed signers, and the expiration time is at least two weeks after the current child chain timestamp."}
{"question": "What are the two APIs exposed by the Data Availability Server (DAS) software, and what are their purposes?", "answer": "The DAS exposes two APIs: the Sequencer API, a JSON-RPC interface for the Sequencer to submit data blocks for storage, and the REST API, a RESTful HTTP(S) based protocol for fetching data blocks by hash, available to the world."}
{"question": "What are the different storage options supported by the DAS software?", "answer": "The DAS software can store its data in local files, or in a Badger database, or on Amazon S3, or redundantly across multiple backing stores."}
{"question": "How does the Arbitrum sequencer interact with Committee members to post data using the Committee?", "answer": "The sequencer sends the batch's data and an expiration time via RPC to all Committee members in parallel, who then store the data, sign it, and return a signature to the sequencer."}
{"question": "What happens if the Sequencer fails to collect enough signatures from Committee members within a few minutes?", "answer": "The Sequencer will abandon the attempt to use the Committee and 'fall back to rollup' by posting the full data directly to the parent chain, as it would do in a non-AnyTrust chain."}
{"question": "What is the current status of Arbitrum's decentralization?", "answer": "Arbitrum technology has not yet achieved its full promise of being fully decentralized, currently relying on a permissioned list of validators."}
{"question": "What is the role of the permissioned list of validators in Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The permissioned list of validators verifies messaging from Arbitrum One back to Ethereum and can prevent invalid withdrawals, but limits accountability to those outside the list."}
{"question": "Why is Arbitrum One categorized as a 'Stage 1 Rollup' on the L2Beat website?", "answer": "Arbitrum One is categorized as a 'Stage 1 Rollup' because it still relies on a permissioned list of validators, which prevents it from reaching its full potential and being considered fully decentralized."}
{"question": "What is the main idea behind the 'optimistic' rollup technology powering Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The main idea is that claims about its state are settled to and confirmed on Ethereum after a period of approximately seven days, during which they can be disputed."}
{"question": "How does Arbitrum's decentralization property allow for the protection of users' funds and withdrawals?", "answer": "A key decentralization property allows anyone who knows the correct claim to challenge invalid claims and win the challenge, preserving the accurate history of Arbitrum settling to Ethereum."}
{"question": "What is the main goal of the new dispute resolution protocol called BoLD (Bounded Liquidity Delay) for Arbitrum chains?", "answer": "The main goal of BoLD is to bring Arbitrum chains to the next level of decentralization by allowing permissionless validation, enabling anyone to challenge invalid claims made about Arbitrum states."}
{"question": "What is the process by which Arbitrum chains settle their states to a parent chain, and how does it ensure the correctness of batches on Ethereum?", "answer": "Arbitrum chains settle their states to a parent chain by posting compressed batches of all L2 transactions to Ethereum, and the correctness of these batches is verified through a separate process called the 'batch correctness confirmation' process, which involves validators checking the correctness of batches and proposing assertions that attest to the validity of a batch."}
{"question": "How does the permissionless validation enabled by Arbitrum BoLD change the way assertions are proposed and challenged on Ethereum, and what is the role of validators in this process?", "answer": "Arbitrum BoLD enables any entity, such as the ArbitrumDAO, to remove the permissioned list of proposers who could post assertions and challenge assertions for all Arbitrum chains, allowing anyone to propose assertions and challenge them, with validators playing a key role in checking the correctness of batches and proposing assertions that attest to their validity."}
{"question": "What is the timeline for disputing assertions on Ethereum, and how does this process ensure the security and finality of transactions on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "Ethereum allows about seven days for anyone to dispute one of these assertions, after which the batch is considered finalized, ensuring the security and finality of transactions on Arbitrum One, as once a batched is included in a finalized block on Ethereum, its history will likely never be reverted on Arbitrum One."}
{"question": "What is required for a withdrawal from Arbitrum One to be fully executed on Ethereum?", "answer": "A confirmed assertion on Ethereum that matches the corresponding claim"}
{"question": "Why does the dispute period for assertions about Arbitrum One on Ethereum exist, and how long does it last?", "answer": "The dispute period exists because Ethereum has no knowledge of what is correct on Arbitrum One, and it lasts for seven days to allow parties to catch and challenge invalid claims"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the 'settling states' process and the seven-day dispute window in ensuring safe withdrawals from Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The purpose is to provide strong security guarantees without needing to trust a group of validators, by allowing anyone to dispute invalid claims and win, through 'permissionless validation'"}
{"question": "What happens when an honest party disagrees with an assertion on Ethereum and posts a counter-claim?", "answer": "An actual dispute occurs, creating a 'fork' in the chain of assertions, requiring a resolution process."}
{"question": "How long does the Arbitrum BoLD protocol guarantee that a dispute will be resolved?", "answer": "Within seven days, so long as an honest party or parties are present to defend against invalid claims and have access to enough resources to pay for the costs of participating in the protocol."}
{"question": "What is the maximum delay in assertion resolution if a dispute is made at the last second?", "answer": "14 days, or two weeks, due to the 7-day dispute window and the additional 7 days required to resolve the dispute."}
{"question": "What happens to pending withdrawals from Arbitrum One back to Ethereum when a dispute is raised?", "answer": "All pending withdrawals are delayed, not just the single claim in dispute."}
{"question": "Why is it necessary for disputing a claim to have a cost for the initiator on Arbitrum?", "answer": "To make the initiator accountable for the opportunity cost they impose on other Arbitrum users due to the delay caused by their dispute."}
{"question": "What is required from a proposer (a type of validator) to propose assertions on Arbitrum One and why?", "answer": "A proposer must make a security deposit or 'bond' to prevent abuse and delays in withdrawals, which can be withdrawn once their latest assertion is confirmed."}
{"question": "What is the role of proposers in the Arbitrum BoLD system, and what is required of them to propose state assertions to the parent chain?", "answer": "Proposers must bond ETH to propose state assertions to the parent chain, and only one proposer is needed for chain progress."}
{"question": "How does the pricing of the 'security deposit' or bond in Arbitrum BoLD account for potential risks, such as a 'bank run'-like scenario?", "answer": "The pricing of the bond is based on opportunity cost, taking into account a conservative estimate of the potential loss of approximately $3.27M USD if funds could earn a 5% APY elsewhere, and recommends a bond greater than $3.7M USD."}
{"question": "What are the consequences for honest proposers versus adversaries in the Arbitrum BoLD system, particularly with regards to their bonds?", "answer": "Honest proposers can withdraw their bond once their assertions are confirmed, while adversaries stand to lose the entirety of their bond if they propose invalid assertions."}
{"question": "Why are high bonding values recommended for participation in BoLD?", "answer": "To disincentivize malicious actors from attacking Arbitrum One and to mitigate against spam that would delay confirmations."}
{"question": "How can high bonding values be made accessible to a wider range of participants without harming decentralization?", "answer": "Through the use of permissionless bonding or staking pools, and by allowing any number of honest parties to bond their funds to the correct assertion and participate in the defense of Arbitrum."}
{"question": "What token and bond sizes are recommended for use with BoLD on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The `WETH` ERC-20 token, although the bond sizes are not specified in the provided text."}
{"question": "What is the recommended ERC-20 token for assertion bonds and challenge-bonds on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "WETH"}
{"question": "What is the size of the assertion bond required from validators to bond their funds to an assertion on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "3600 ETH"}
{"question": "What are the sizes of the challenge-bonds per level for validators to open challenges against an assertion observed on the parent chain on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "555 WETH at the 'big-step' level and 79 WETH at the 'small-step' level"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the carefully calculated values in the BoLD system?", "answer": "To optimize for the resource ratio and gas costs in the event of an attack."}
{"question": "How can the challenge bond amounts be put together for participation in the interactive dispute game?", "answer": "Via a trustless bonding pool, which can be contributed to by multiple parties, including the validator that opened the challenge and the community."}
{"question": "How does BoLD address centralization concerns related to requiring high bonds to post assertions?", "answer": "By shipping with a trustless bonding pool that allows any group of honest parties to pool funds into a simple contract, eliminating the need for trust and enabling decentralized participation in assertion posting."}
{"question": "Why is it important to set a high bond fee for becoming a proposer in Arbitrum One?", "answer": "It should be expensive to delay Arbitrum One withdrawals, and there should be a high barrier to entry to perform a key responsibility."}
{"question": "What is the role of Ethereum in resolving disputes related to Arbitrum One assertions?", "answer": "Ethereum acts as a neutral referee, relying on a dispute game to be played out between parties making claims with proof, and ultimately verifies a one-step proof (OSP) to declare a winner."}
{"question": "What is the core property achieved by BoLD in terms of dispute resolution times?", "answer": "BoLD provides a fixed upper bound for dispute resolution times."}
{"question": "What is the core principle of the BoLD dispute protocol?", "answer": "The core principle is that an honest party winning a one-step proof leaves the malicious party with no other moves to make."}
{"question": "How do claims work in the BoLD dispute protocol compared to other protocols?", "answer": "Claims in BoLD are attached to Merkle commitments of an Arbitrum chain's history, rather than being tied to a specific Ethereum address or validator."}
{"question": "What is enabled by the BoLD dispute protocol that allows honest parties to cooperate without needing direct communication?", "answer": "BoLD enables 'trustless cooperation' because honest parties can make claims and moves on the correct history without needing to communicate with each other."}
{"question": "What is the primary goal of introducing an economic cost associated with making moves in the dispute game?", "answer": "To prevent spam attacks in dispute games."}
{"question": "How does the BoLD research paper estimate the marginal cost of a party in a dispute?", "answer": "By considering the number of adversary moves multiplied by the gas cost of making bisections and claims, as well as estimates of offchain computational costs."}
{"question": "Why is it necessary to play the dispute game at different levels of granularity in BoLD?", "answer": "Because the space of disagreements between parties is of max size 2^69, making it computationally feasible only by playing the game at different levels of granularity."}
{"question": "How can the BoLD protocol detect and discourage spam in disputes on Ethereum?", "answer": "The protocol detects and discourages spam by putting a price tag on making moves, looking at the 'resource ratio' between honest and malicious parties, and requiring parties to lock up capital in 'mini-bonds' when making big claims."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the 'resource ratio' in the BoLD research paper?", "answer": "The 'resource ratio' is computed as gas plus staking (or bonding) marginal costs of the adversary to the honest party, and it helps to discourage spam by making it more costly for malicious parties to make claims."}
{"question": "What are 'mini-bonds' in the context of BoLD disputes, and when are they required?", "answer": "Mini-bonds are capital that parties must lock up when making big claims in a dispute, but not when making bisection moves; they help achieve a high resource ratio of dishonest parties to honest parties."}
{"question": "What is another term for 'challenge-bonds' mentioned above in Pricing bonds?", "answer": "Mini-bonds"}
{"question": "How can the cost to malicious parties be made higher than the honest parties' to achieve significant security benefits?", "answer": "By making the bond amount at one level a certain multiplier (e.g. 10x) more than the next, as you go upward from subchallenges towards the assertion-level challenge"}
{"question": "What is the trade-off of having a high constant resource ratio of malicious to honest costs?", "answer": "The required bond size in ETH increases as a polynomial at a particular challenge level, making it potentially unreasonable (e.g. 1M ETH or $2.56B USD for a 1000x resource ratio)"}
{"question": "What is the proposed resource ratio for Arbitrum One and how was it calculated?", "answer": "The proposed resource ratio for Arbitrum One is 6.46, which was calculated taking into account the initial 'bond' to become a proposer and a worst-case scenario of 500 gwei/gas on L1 for posting assertions and making subchallenge moves."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between the cost of attacking and defending in BoLD under the proposed parameters?", "answer": "For every $6.46 spent by malicious parties attacking, only $1 is needed to defend it successfully in BoLD."}
{"question": "Is there a universal framework for choosing the resource ratio for any chain, or what is recommended instead?", "answer": "There is no 'one size fits all' framework for choosing the resource ratio; instead, teams are recommended to learn and understand the benefits and trade-offs of operating BoLD in a permissionless format and perform their own economic risk analyses."}
{"question": "What is the main challenge in incentivizing honest validators in optimistic rollup protocols like Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The main challenge is the 'verifier's dilemma', where honest validators may not check results because they can free ride on others' efforts."}

{"question": "What is the purpose of introducing a service fee for active proposers in Arbitrum BoLD?", "answer": "To remove the disincentive for participation by honest parties who bond their own capital and propose assertions for Arbitrum One."}
{"question": "How will the service fee be calculated and paid out to active proposers?", "answer": "The service fee will be calculated using the duration of time that the proposer was considered active by the protocol, and will be paid out upon an active proposer's top-level assertion being confirmed on Ethereum."}
{"question": "Will the Arbitrum Foundation's proposer, which is run as a public good, earn a service fee?", "answer": "No, the Arbitrum Foundation's proposer will not earn a service fee since it is being run using the community's own money and is considered a public good."}
{"question": "What is required for a validator to become an active proposer for an Arbitrum chain post-BoLD?", "answer": "A validator has to propose a state assertion to its parent chain, and if they do not have an active bond on L1, they need to attach a bond to their assertion."}
{"question": "What happens to the bond of a previous proposer when a new entity posts a successor assertion?", "answer": "The previous proposer's bond is refunded once their assertion is confirmed, and the new entity becomes the current active proposer."}

{"question": "How are honest parties rewarded for participating in the interactive fraud-proof game in Arbitrum One?", "answer": "Honest parties are not automatically rewarded with all the funds seized from malicious actors, but instead, refunds of challenge bonds for honest parties and confiscation of bonds from malicious parties are handled automatically by the protocol."}
{"question": "What happens to a validator's bond once all of their proposed assertions are confirmed in the Arbitrum One protocol?", "answer": "The validator can withdraw their bond in full, and the protocol will handle refunds of challenge bonds for honest parties and confiscation of bonds from malicious parties."}
{"question": "What is the requirement for eligible entities to receive the defender's bounty from the ArbitrumDAO?", "answer": "They must undergo the Arbitrum Foundation\u2019s KYC process."}
{"question": "Why are bond sizes recommended to be high enough in optimistic rollup dispute protocols?", "answer": "To discourage challenges from being opened, as malicious parties will always stand to lose when playing the game."}

{"question": "What type of validation does the BoLD protocol enable for chains?", "answer": "Permissionless validation"}
{"question": "What is the current limitation for validation on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova?", "answer": "Validation is currently limited to an allow-listed set of parties maintained by the Arbitrum DAO."}
{"question": "How does BoLD mitigate the risks of delay attacks on Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum?", "answer": "BoLD's design ensures disputes will be resolved within a fixed time window, currently set to equal one epoch (~6.4 days) for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova."}
{"question": "What is the significance of enabling permissionless validation on Arbitrum's journey to becoming a Stage 2 Rollup?", "answer": "Enabling permissionless validation allows any honest party to validate and bond their funds to post correct L2 state assertions, making it a key milestone in achieving Stage 2 Rollup status."}
{"question": "What is the primary goal of the BoLD protocol?", "answer": "The primary goal of BoLD is to unlock permissionless validation by ensuring that disputes are resolved within a fixed period, removing the risk of delay attacks and making withdrawals to a parent chain more secure."}
{"question": "How does the BoLD protocol enhance security around L2 to L1 messages?", "answer": "BoLD enhances security around all L2 to L1 messages (including withdrawals) by introducing a new dispute system that lets any single entity defend Arbitrum against malicious parties, allowing anyone to validate, propose, and defend an Arbitrum chain\u2019s state without needing permission to do so."}
{"question": "What are the responsibilities of a bonded validator under the BoLD protocol?", "answer": "A bonded validator's responsibilities under BoLD include posting claims about an Arbitrum chain\u2019s state to its parent chain, opening challenges to dispute invalid claims made by other validators, and confirming valid claims by participating in and winning challenges."}
{"question": "Why does Arbitrum need a new dispute protocol?", "answer": "Arbitrum needs a new dispute protocol because the current one is not permissionless and time-bounded, which can be improved with innovative changes that let anyone challenge and win disputes within a fixed time period."}
{"question": "What property of Arbitrum states allows for time-bound, permissionless validation?", "answer": "The property that a correct Arbitrum state is not tied to the entity that bonds their capital to a claim, coupled with the fact that the states are completely deterministic and can be proven on Ethereum."}
{"question": "What is the minimum number of honest parties required to defend Arbitrum?", "answer": "There needs to only be one honest party defending Arbitrum."}
{"question": "What is the final stage of rollup development according to Vitalik and the L2Beat framework?", "answer": "Stage 2 - No Training Wheels"}
{"question": "What is a critical criterion for being considered a Stage 2 rollup?", "answer": "Allowing anyone to validate the child and post fraud proofs to Ethereum without restraints"}

{"question": "Why do users have to wait approximately 1 week to withdraw assets from Arbitrum One after a state assertion?", "answer": "Because of the 'challenge period' where any validator can open a dispute over the validity of the child chain state root, and it takes around 6.4 days for this period to pass without disputes."}
{"question": "What vulnerability does BoLD aim to mitigate in the withdrawal process from Arbitrum to the parent chain Ethereum?", "answer": "Delay attacks, where malicious actors continuously open disputes to extend the challenge period indefinitely by sacrificing bonds and resolving each dispute one by one."}
{"question": "What is the primary mechanism by which BoLD addresses disputes within a time limit?", "answer": "BoLD introduces a time limit on the existing rollup protocol for resolving disputes, allowing challenges to conclude within a 6.4-day window."}
{"question": "How does BoLD's design enable efficient dispute resolution compared to Arbitrum's current protocol?", "answer": "BoLD allows for challenges between the honest party and any number of malicious adversaries to happen in parallel, unlike Arbitrum's sequential approach."}
{"question": "What is the consequence if a challenger fails to respond within the time limit set by BoLD?", "answer": "The honest party's claims will be automatically confirmed if the challenger fails to respond within the time limit."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the BoLD protocol in the context of Arbitrum chains?", "answer": "The BoLD protocol provides the guardrails and rules for how validators challenge claims about the state of an Arbitrum chain."}
{"question": "How does the deterministic nature of Arbitrum's state impact the resolution of disputes?", "answer": "Since Arbitrum\u2019s state is deterministic, there will always be only one correct state for a given input of on-chain operations and transactions."}
{"question": "What benefit does BoLD's design provide in terms of resolving disputes within a fixed time window?", "answer": "BoLD\u2019s design guarantees that disputes will be resolved within a fixed time window, removing the risk of delay attacks and ultimately enabling anyone to bond their funds to and successfully defend that singular correct state of Arbitrum."}
{"question": "What is the process that validators follow to confirm the state of an Arbitrum chain?", "answer": "Validators take the most recent confirmed assertion, called Block A, and assert that some number of transactions afterward will result in an end state, Block Z, and if nobody disagrees after a certain amount of time, the state represented by Block Z is confirmed as the correct state."}
{"question": "What happens if a validator claims that the end state represented by Block Z is correct?", "answer": "The validator will bond their funds to Block Z and propose that state to its parent chain."}
{"question": "What occurs when someone disagrees with the end state Block Z during the challenge period?", "answer": "The person can submit a challenge, at which point BoLD comes into play to resolve the dispute."}
{"question": "What happens when another validator observes and disagrees with the end state represented by Block Z?", "answer": "They can permissionlessly open a challenge by asserting and bonding capital to a claim on a different end state, represented by an assertion Block Y."}
{"question": "What are the asserted states referred to as after a challenge is opened?", "answer": "Each of these asserted states are referred to as edges while a Merkle tree of asserted states from some start to endpoint is more formally known as a history commitment."}
{"question": "Where are the bonds put up to open challenges held?", "answer": "The bonds put up to open challenges are held in the rollup contract."}
{"question": "What is the goal of the multi-level, interactive process in resolving disputes between disagreeing entities?", "answer": "The goal is to come to an agreement on what the actual, correct asserted state should be by narrowing down their disagreement through a bisection process."}
{"question": "How do disputing parties identify the specific block that they disagree on during the block challenge phase?", "answer": "The parties take turns bisecting their history commitments until they identify the specific block that they disagree on, starting with level-zero edges at the granularity of Arbitrum blocks."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the big-step challenge phase in the dispute resolution process?", "answer": "The purpose of the big-step challenge phase is to narrow down the disagreement to a specific range of instructions for the State Transition Function within a block, working towards identifying a set of instructions within which their disagreement lies."}
{"question": "What happens when parties disagree on a single step of instruction in the Arbitrum protocol?", "answer": "The parties agree on the initial state of Arbitrum before the step but disagree on the end state one step immediately after, and they proceed to generate a one-step proof."}
{"question": "How does the smart contract on the parent chain validate the correctness of a submitted one-step proof?", "answer": "The smart contract executes the disputed step to validate the correctness of a submitted proof from the two parties, and it deems the honest party's proof valid while rejecting the dishonest party's proof by timeout."}
{"question": "What happens to a level-zero edge in the Arbitrum protocol if the timer reaches the challenge period T?", "answer": "The level-zero edge is automatically confirmed if the timer reaches the challenge period T, regardless of the challenge outcome."}
{"question": "Who handles reimbursements for the honest party's L1 gas costs and mini-bonds?", "answer": "The Arbitrum Foundation"}
{"question": "What type of costs are reimbursed by the Arbitrum Foundation for the honest party?", "answer": "L1 gas costs and mini-bonds"}
{"question": "At what levels are mini-bonds made that are eligible for reimbursement by the Arbitrum Foundation?", "answer": "Other challenge levels"}
{"question": "What is the main reason why BoLD can guarantee that disputes are resolved within a fixed time frame?", "answer": "Because each of the steps explained above can take place concurrently"}
{"question": "How do validators dispute challenges with the BoLD protocol?", "answer": "Validators dispute challenges by walking through each of the steps outlined in the protocol, which can occur concurrently"}
{"question": "What is bonding and how does it relate to the BoLD protocol?", "answer": "Bonding is a mechanism that works within the BoLD protocol, but its specifics are not detailed here and are instead addressed in the FAQ section"}
{"question": "How does bonding work?", "answer": "Bonding requires validators to put in a security deposit, known as a bond, to be allowed to post assertions about Arbitrum state to Ethereum. Validators can withdraw their bond once their latest posted assertion has been confirmed."}
{"question": "Why are the bond sizes so high for Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The bond sizes are set to a large enough value (e.g., 200 WETH) to make it economically infeasible for an adversary to attack an Arbitrum chain and to mitigate against spam that would otherwise delay confirmations."}
{"question": "How do bonding pools address the centralization concern of high bond values?", "answer": "Bonding pools allow anyone to deploy a pool as a way of crowdsourcing funds from others who wish to help defend Arbitrum, making it possible for individuals to participate without having to put up the large upfront bond themselves."}
{"question": "Why are the bond sizes so high for Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The bond sizes are carefully calculated and set using a variety of factors, including TVL and optimizing for a balance between cost for honest parties and security of the protocol, to act as a deterrence against delay attacks."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of assertion bond sizes in Arbitrum One?", "answer": "Assertion bond sizes can be thought of as a 'security deposit' that an entity puts down to fulfill the role of a proposer and ensure the chain progresses, while also acting as a deterrence against delay attacks."}
{"question": "How do validators who choose to be proposers interact with their assertion bonds in Arbitrum One?", "answer": "Validators who choose to be proposers can withdraw their bond as soon as their most recent posted assertion has been confirmed by the protocol."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of challenge bonds in the context of resolving disputes on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "To prevent resource exhaustion and spam from adversaries by requiring an additional bond for certain moves within a challenge."}
{"question": "How was the specific challenge bond size of 1110 ETH for Arbitrum One determined?", "answer": "Using a 'resource ratio' that ensures a malicious party pays 10x the marginal costs of an honest party when participating in the interactive fraud proof game."}
{"question": "What happens to the bonds of honest and malicious parties after a dispute is resolved on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "Honest parties get their bonds refunded, while malicious parties lose everything."}
{"question": "What happens to the $1B put up by an adversary if a challenge is won?", "answer": "The $1B put up by an adversary would be lost."}
{"question": "How do bonding pools contribute to the defense of Arbitrum trustlessly?", "answer": "Bonding pools allow any group of participants to pool their funds together to challenge a dishonest proposer and win, without needing to trust each other."}
{"question": "Is validating Arbitrum One only accessible to whales due to the bond requirement?", "answer": "No, validating Arbitrum One is free and accessible, as all Arbitrum One nodes can detect and report invalid assertions posted to Ethereum by default."}
{"question": "How does BoLD disincentivize malicious actors from attacking an Arbitrum chain?", "answer": "Bonds put up by honest parties will always be refunded while malicious actors always stand to lose 100% of their bond."}
{"question": "In the event of a challenge, what happens to the confiscated funds from malicious actors for Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The malicious actor will lose all of their funds, which are confiscated, while the honest party will eventually have their bonds reimbursed."}
{"question": "What is required to become an assertion proposer on Arbitrum One and why?", "answer": "A bond is required to become an assertion proposer, as without it, anyone could delay all Arbitrum bridged assets by one week."}
{"question": "What happens to the costs spent by malicious actors in BoLD?", "answer": "The costs are confiscated and sent to the Arbitrum DAO treasury."}
{"question": "How will the Arbitrum DAO decide what to do with the confiscated funds from a malicious actor?", "answer": "The Arbitrum DAO will have full discretion over what to do with the funds, including using them to refund parent chain gas costs, rewarding honest parties, burning them, or keeping them in the treasury."}
{"question": "Why are honest parties not automatically rewarded with confiscated funds from a malicious actor?", "answer": "Because an adversary can sometimes profit by placing the honest stakes themselves, creating perverse incentives that threaten the security of BoLD."}
{"question": "What happens when the protocol gives the honest proposer 20% of the confiscated bond in a delay attack scenario?", "answer": "The attack costs the attacker $4M, because they can post both bonds and get back the honest $5M bond, plus a $1M reward."}
{"question": "Why is it not harmful to pay the honest proposer a fair interest rate on their bond?", "answer": "So they don't suffer for having helped the protocol by locking up their capital in a bond."}
{"question": "How will the reward for honest parties be calculated and distributed in the BoLD AIP proposal?", "answer": "The exact amount rewarded will be proportional to the amount defenders deposited into the protocol during a challenge, calculated off-chain, and payouts will require a DAO vote."}
{"question": "Why was $ARB not chosen as the bonding token used in BoLD on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "Because Ethereum, specifically WETH, has greater liquidity, its value is relatively independent of Arbitrum, and it already provides security for Arbitrum One and Nova."}
{"question": "What potential issue could arise if $ARB were used as the bonding token in BoLD?", "answer": "Adversaries might exploit the potential instability of $ARB by creating an impression that they have a nontrivial chance of winning challenges, driving down its value and making attacks cheaper."}
{"question": "Where are fraud proofs submitted to and arbitrated on, and what implications does this have for bonding token choice?", "answer": "Fraud proofs are submitted to and arbitrated on L1 Ethereum, which means that the bonding of capital is done on L1 Ethereum, making it more practical to use Ethereum as the bonding token."}
{"question": "Can the required token for the validator be set to $ARB and can network $ETH revenues be distributed for validator incentives for Arbitrum One?", "answer": "Yes, the asset that a validator uses to become a proposer in BoLD can be set to any ERC-20 token, including $ARB."}
{"question": "How are honest parties reimbursed for bonding their capital to help secure Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The source and denomination of funds used to incentivize validators will be at the discretion of the Arbitrum DAO."}
{"question": "Can $ARB-based bonding be used as an economic incentive model for validators on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "No, $ARB-based bonding is not seen as a good idea at present."}
{"question": "How does the Arbitrum DAO incentivize active proposers to participate?", "answer": "The Arbitrum DAO reimburses active proposers with a fair interest rate, denominated in ETH, equal to the annualized yield that Ethereum mainnet validators receive."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the interest payment to honest proposers in the Arbitrum DAO?", "answer": "The interest payment is considered a reimbursement for the opportunity cost of locking up their capital and should not be perceived as a reward."}
{"question": "How are the reimbursement payments to active proposers calculated and handled?", "answer": "The reimbursement payments are calculated and handled off-chain by the Arbitrum Foundation, paid out upon an active proposer's honest assertion being confirmed on Ethereum."}
{"question": "What is required for a validator to become an active proposer on Arbitrum One post-BoLD?", "answer": "A validator must propose a child chain state assertion to Ethereum and have an active bond on the parent chain."}
{"question": "How does the protocol handle multiple entities proposing assertions, and what happens to the previous proposer's bond?", "answer": "The protocol considers the latest entity to post a successor assertion as the current active proposer, and the previous proposer's bond is refunded once their assertion is confirmed."}
{"question": "Can chain owners on Orbit chains implement their own economic models alongside BoLD, and are there any restrictions?", "answer": "Yes, chain owners can implement any economic model they choose alongside BoLD if they decide to adopt it, without any restrictions."}
{"question": "For Orbit chains, can any economic model be implemented alongside BoLD?", "answer": "Yes, if chain owners decide to adopt BoLD."}
{"question": "Is the service fee for Arbitrum One proposers applied to the amount bonded?", "answer": "Yes, the fee is applied to the total amount bonded over the duration of time that a proposer is active."}
{"question": "Which assets are used to generate yield for the service fee in Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The decision on the source of funds for the yield is entirely up to the ArbitrumDAO to decide, but deposited $ETH into the contracts on the parent chain will be unable to be used for yield in other scenarios."}
{"question": "For Arbitrum One, will the off-chain compute costs be reimbursed?", "answer": "No, reimbursement will not be made for off-chain compute costs as these are viewed as costs borne by all honest operators."}
{"question": "How much does it cost to run a sub-challenge in BoLD on an AWS r5.4xlarge EC2 instance?", "answer": "Around $2.50 USD (~$1/hour for one challenge with 2.5 hour duration) using on-demand prices for US East (N. Virginia)."}
{"question": "How will BoLD impact Arbitrum Nova?", "answer": "BoLD is proposed to be used in both Arbitrum One and Nova, but Nova will remain permissioned with a DAO-controlled allowlist of entities."}
{"question": "Why was the decision made not to enable permissionless validation for Arbitrum Nova?", "answer": "The decision was made due to two reasons: firstly, the high bond sizes necessary for preventing spam and delay attacks would make up a significant proportion of Nova's TVL, introducing a centralization risk, and secondly, lowering the bond sizes would reduce the costs of delay griefing attacks and hurt the security of the chain."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between Arbitrum Nova's security and the DAC members?", "answer": "Arbitrum Nova's security already depends on at least one DAC member providing honest data availability, and trusting the same committee to have at least one member provide honest validation does not add a major trust assumption, as long as all DAC members also run validators."}
{"question": "What is the expected outcome of the DAC attesting to and instantly confirming an assertion on Fast Withdrawals?", "answer": "The DAC attesting to and instantly confirming an assertion would allow users to withdraw assets from Nova in approximately 15 minutes, or the time it takes to reach parent chain finality."}
{"question": "Is it possible for an attacker to go above the security budget of Arbitrum One?", "answer": "Yes, a malicious entity can post multiple invalid top level assertions and/or open multiple challenges."}
{"question": "What happens to the honest party if they are bonded to the correct state assertion in Arbitrum?", "answer": "The honest party will get all their costs refunded."}
{"question": "What is the upfront capital required to post assertions on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "3600 ETH"}
{"question": "What is required for a malicious entity to propose an invalid state assertion on Arbitrum?", "answer": "A deposit of 3600 ETH"}
{"question": "What are the different modes that an Arbitrum node can run in, and which ones require funds and take on-chain action?", "answer": "The modes are watchtower, stakeLatest, resolveNodes, makeNodes, and defensive. All modes except watchtower require funds and take on-chain action."}
{"question": "What is the role of a proposer in Arbitrum, and what mode do they run their node in?", "answer": "A proposer is someone running an Arbitrum node in makeNodes mode, also making them a validator."}
{"question": "What is required for assertions to be resolved fairly on L2s, like Arbitrum One, using the BoLD protocol?", "answer": "A credibly-neutral, censorship-resistant backend, such as Ethereum."}
{"question": "How do L3 Orbit chains that don\u2019t settle to Ethereum post assertions on their state?", "answer": "Assertions on an L3\u2019s state need to be posted to an L2 either via (A) the L3 or (B) the queue managed by the L2 sequencer on L2."}
{"question": "What is the potential delay in challenge resolution if the parent chain (L2) is being repeatedly censored or if the L2 sequencer is offline?", "answer": "The delay would be t = (24 hours) * number of moves for a challenge, which could be significant (e.g., 50 days for a challenge with 50 sequential moves)."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the Delay Buffer feature in BoLD's 1.0.0 release?", "answer": "The Delay Buffer feature aims to limit the negative effects of prolonged parent chain censorship, prolonged sequencer censorship, and/or unexpected sequencer outages."}
{"question": "How does the force inclusion window change when the time threshold is met in the Delay Buffer feature?", "answer": "Once the time threshold is met, the force inclusion window is lowered from 24 hours to a minimum inclusion time, effectively enabling entities to make moves without the 24 hour delay-per-move."}
{"question": "Under what conditions does the force inclusion window replenish to its original value over time?", "answer": "The force inclusion window replenishes to its original value over time as long as the sequencer is on 'good behavior' - regularly sequencing messages without unexpected delays."}
{"question": "What is the current status of the autopooling feature?", "answer": "The autopooling feature is not available as of yet."}
{"question": "How can an entity defend Arbitrum using a bonding pool?", "answer": "An entity would first deploy a pool with the assertion they believe is correct and wish to put up a bond to challenge an adversary's assertion, then others can deposit funds into the contract if they agree with the assertion."}
{"question": "What happens when the honest parties' assertion is confirmed by the dispute protocol?", "answer": "All involved entities can get their funds reimbursed and can withdraw."}
{"question": "How do BoLD validators communicate with one another?", "answer": "BoLD validators for Arbitrum chains communicate directly with smart contracts on L1 Ethereum, with no P2P between validators."}
{"question": "For an L3 Orbit chain secured using BoLD that settles to Arbitrum One, does the one-step proof happen on the parent chain?", "answer": "Yes, it happens on Arbitrum One."}
{"question": "For Arbitrum One, does implementing BoLD reduce the scope or remove the need for the Arbitrum Security Council?", "answer": "BoLD can limit the scope of Arbitrum One and Nova\u2019s reliance on the Security Council as it takes Arbitrum chains one-step closer to full decentralization."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the public preview disclaimer in Offchain Labs' product documentation?", "answer": "The purpose of the public preview disclaimer is to set expectations and invite readers to express their needs so that they can be incorporated into the product iteration process."}
{"question": "How does Offchain Labs approach product development, and what are the benefits of this approach?", "answer": "Offchain Labs builds products by releasing them early and often, allowing for feedback and iteration to capture user needs empirically, which enables incremental improvements and significant changes based on user input."}
{"question": "What can users expect when using public preview offerings from Offchain Labs, in terms of release notes and updates?", "answer": "Users can expect rapid evolution, notifications regarding patch, minor, and major changes, and corresponding release notes that highlight breaking changes and new capabilities, but not the same level of release notes discipline as stable offerings."}
{"question": "What are the primary feedback channels used by the product team for public preview capabilities?", "answer": "The product team uses three feedback channels: Docs, Discord, and Google form."}
{"question": "How can I provide feedback on the documentation and/or developer experience?", "answer": "You can click on the 'Request an update' button located in the top-right corner of any document to provide feedback, which will lead you to a prefilled Github issue."}
{"question": "What can I expect after providing feedback to the product team?", "answer": "The team will try their best to acknowledge and respond to your feedback, but they cannot guarantee responses to all submissions due to their evolving capacity and priorities."}
{"question": "What are the two primary data availability mechanisms supported by Arbitrum?", "answer": "Rollup Mode and Anytrust Mode"}
{"question": "How does data availability work in Rollup Mode on Arbitrum?", "answer": "In Rollup Mode, all transaction data is included in either the calldata of transactions submitted to the parent chain or the blobs submitted by the transaction."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the Data Availability Certificate (DACert) in Anytrust Mode on Arbitrum?", "answer": "The DACert is a cryptographic proof that the data has been stored by the Data Availability Committee (DAC), which is submitted to the parent chain instead of the entire dataset, reducing the amount of data stored on-chain and costs."}
{"question": "What is the process of batching and submission in Arbitrum data flow?", "answer": "The sequencer queues transactions, batches them together, and submits these batches to the parent chain, either directly in Rollup mode or via the Data Availability Committee (DAC) in Anytrust mode."}
{"question": "How do full nodes synchronize with the network in Arbitrum?", "answer": "Full nodes read data from the parent chain calldata or blobs in Rollup mode, or check the DACert and query data from the DAC in Anytrust mode, to catch up with the latest chain height, and then receive updates directly from the sequencer feed."}
{"question": "What happens if a node falls behind the chain in Arbitrum?", "answer": "If a node falls behind, it reverts to the process of reading data from the parent chain or checking the DACert to resynchronize with the latest state, as described in the node synchronization step."}
{"question": "What is involved in the process of updating the local state of Arbitrum full nodes?", "answer": "Monitoring events, parsing data, and processing messages"}
{"question": "Where do Arbitrum full nodes receive data from to update their local state?", "answer": "The parent chain and, in the case of AnyTrust chains, the DAC"}
{"question": "What action do Arbitrum full nodes perform on the data received from the parent chain and DAC?", "answer": "Decode the data to update their local state"}
{"question": "What event do full nodes subscribe to in order to receive new batches of transactions from the inbox contract on the parent chain?", "answer": "SequencerBatchDelivered"}
{"question": "What information is typically included in the SequencerInboxBatch struct when parsing event data from the SequencerBatchDelivered event?", "answer": "BlockHash, ParentChainBlockNumber, SequenceNumber, TimeBounds, AfterDelayedAcc, AfterDelayedCount, and rawLog"}
{"question": "How does the node retrieve raw data based on the payload header in the serialized SequencerInboxBatch struct?", "answer": "The node queries the Data Availability Servers (DAS) for DAS Message headers, decodes blob messages for Blob message headers, and takes no extra steps for Brotli Message headers"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of decoding a blob message in the context of an Arbitrum node?", "answer": "To obtain the raw data."}
{"question": "How does the node handle Brotli-compressed raw data obtained from decoding a blob message or receiving a Brotli Message header?", "answer": "The node decompresses it if necessary, as the raw data might also be Brotli-compressed."}
{"question": "What is the role of the State Transition Function (STF) in processing batch segment messages after decoding and decompression?", "answer": "The STF processes these messages according to predefined rules, executing updates to the Arbitrum node's local state based on message types such as transaction data, delayed messages, timestamp advancements, or L1 block number advancements."}
{"question": "How do full nodes switch from initial synchronization to real-time update mode?", "answer": "Full nodes switch from initial synchronization to a real-time update mode by receiving data from the sequencer feed, which continuously broadcasts updates about newly queued transactions."}

{"question": "What happens to the decoded message after successful decoding in full nodes?", "answer": "After successful decoding, the full nodes obtain the same type of data and send the message to the State Transition Function (STF) and execute."}
{"question": "What are the two parties a user pays when submitting a transaction on Arbitrum?", "answer": "The poster (if reimbursable) for parent chain resources and the network fee account for child chain resources."}
{"question": "How is the parent chain component of the fee calculated on Arbitrum?", "answer": "It is the product of the estimated contribution to the transaction's size (computed using Brotli) and the child chain's view of the parent chain data price, which dynamically adjusts over time."}
{"question": "How does ArbOS determine the pricing for parent chain gas on Arbitrum?", "answer": "ArbOS dynamically prices the parent chain gas, with the price adjusting to ensure that the amount collected in parent chain gas fees is as close as possible to the costs that must be covered over time."}
{"question": "What are the two types of parent chain costs?", "answer": "Batch posting costs and rewards"}
{"question": "How does ArbOS compute the cost of a batch when a batch posting report message arrives at the child chain?", "answer": "By multiplying the reported basefee by the batch's data cost, which is calculated by counting the number of zero bytes and non-zero bytes in the batch"}
{"question": "Who can receive the optional per-unit reward for handling transaction calldata in an AnyTrust chain?", "answer": "Members of the Data Availability Committee or anyone else who incurs per-calldata-byte costs on behalf of the chain"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of parent chain calldata fees in the Sequencer?", "answer": "The parent chain calldata fees exist to cover the costs incurred by the batch poster when posting transactions on Ethereum as calldata."}
{"question": "How is the parent chain calldata fee calculated for each Sequencer transaction?", "answer": "The fee is calculated by estimating the transaction's size, multiplying it by the current price per estimated byte, and then dividing the result by the current child chain basefee to translate it into child chain gas units."}
{"question": "What determines the price per estimated byte in the parent chain pricing algorithm?", "answer": "The price per estimated byte is set by a dynamic algorithm that compares the total parent chain calldata fees collected to the total fees actually paid by batch posters, and adjusts the price to bring the two as close to equality as possible."}
{"question": "Under what condition is a transaction charged for the parent chain gas?", "answer": "A transaction is charged for the parent chain gas if and only if it arrived as part of a sequencer batch."}
{"question": "How is the estimated size of a transaction measured in the parent chain gas?", "answer": "The estimated size is calculated by first compressing the transaction's data using the brotli-zero algorithm, then multiplying the size of the result by 16."}

{"question": "What is the purpose of the parent chain pricer in relation to data units?", "answer": "The parent chain pricer records the total number of 'data units' that have been received, which is calculated by multiplying the estimated sizes by 16 and summing them up."}
{"question": "How does the child chain gas price affect the estimation of transaction fees on Arbitrum?", "answer": "The child chain gas price affects the estimation of transaction fees because the value returned from `eth_estimateGas` multiplied by the child chain gas price gives the total Ether required for a transaction to succeed."}
{"question": "What mechanism is used to set the child chain basefee in Arbitrum, and how does it relate to Ethereum's gas pricing?", "answer": "The child chain basefee in Arbitrum is set by a version of the 'exponential mechanism', which has been shown equivalent to Ethereum's EIP-1559 gas pricing mechanism."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the speed limit parameter in the algorithm?", "answer": "The speed limit parameter is the target amount of gas per second that the chain can handle sustainably over time."}
{"question": "How does the basefee change in relation to the backlog, and what is the formula used to calculate it?", "answer": "The basefee is an exponential function of the backlog, calculated using the formula F = exp(-a(B-b)), where a controls how rapidly the price escalates with backlog, and b allows a small backlog before the basefee escalation begins."}
{"question": "How are gas estimates handled for transactions that schedule subsequent transactions, particularly in the context of retryables and scheduling redeem attempts?", "answer": "A transaction's gas estimate can only be found if all the transactions succeed at a given gas limit, and estimating gas via the node's RPC includes the execution of subsequent scheduled transactions."}
{"question": "Why is it necessary to limit the amount of gas provided to each subcall when making multiple calls to `redeem`?", "answer": "Because the first call will take all of the gas and force the second to fail, irrespective of the estimation's gas limit."}
{"question": "How does the Arbitrum protocol enforce a speed limit on the execution of a Nitro chain?", "answer": "By setting deadlines for assertions, which are enforced by the Rollup protocol contracts, preventing new assertions from being published at a rate faster than a validator can emulate its execution."}
{"question": "Why is accurate estimation of validation time important for setting the speed limit in Nitro chains?", "answer": "Because any uncertainty in estimating validation time will force a lower speed limit to be set, which is undesirable, so accurate estimation enables a higher speed limit to be set safely."}
{"question": "How is the total fee charged to a transaction calculated?", "answer": "The total fee charged to a transaction is the child chain basefee, multiplied by the sum of the child chain gas used plus the parent chain calldata charge."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the allocation fraction F in the pricer's fund allocation process?", "answer": "The allocation fraction F is used to allocate a portion of the funds in the L1PricerFundsPool to the current report, based on the time elapsed between the last update and the current update."}
{"question": "How does the pricer determine the amount of funds to allocate to the current report?", "answer": "The pricer computes an allocation fraction F = (updateTime-lastUpdateTime) / (currentTime-lastUpdateTime) and allocates a fraction F of funds in the L1PricerFundsPool to the current report, assuming that funds arrived at a uniform rate during the interval between lastUpdateTime and currentTime."}
{"question": "What happens to the allocated funds if they are not sufficient to cover all the amounts due?", "answer": "Some amount due will remain."}
{"question": "How can the parent chain gas basefee be queried?", "answer": "The parent chain gas basefee can be queried via ArbGasInfo.getL1BaseFeeEstimate."}
{"question": "What is the goal of adjusting the parent chain gas basefee after allocating funds and paying what is owed?", "answer": "The goal is to find a value that will cause the amount collected to equal the amount owed over time."}
{"question": "What happens to the Basefee when the surplus is increasing?", "answer": "The Basefee is reduced."}
{"question": "How is the second term in the parent chain Gas Basefee calculated?", "answer": "It is based on the derivative of the surplus, which is the difference between the current surplus and the surplus after the previous batch posting report was processed."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of multiplying the second term by a smoothing factor in the Gas Basefee calculation?", "answer": "To reduce fluctuations."}
{"question": "What are the three main layers that make up a Nitro node?", "answer": "The base layer (geth core), the middle layer (ArbOS), and the top layer (node software drawn from geth)"}
{"question": "What is the role of the middle layer, also known as ArbOS, in a Nitro node?", "answer": "It provides additional functions associated with child chain functionality, such as decompressing and parsing data batches, accounting for parent chain gas costs, and supporting cross-chain functionalities"}
{"question": "Why is the structure of a Nitro node referred to as a 'geth sandwich'?", "answer": "Because the top and bottom layers rely heavily on code from geth, with ArbOS acting as the filling in between"}
{"question": "What are the components that make up the STF?", "answer": "The STF consists of the bottom Geth layer, and a portion of the middle ArbOS layer."}
{"question": "How does Nitro store ArbOS's state in relation to Geth?", "answer": "ArbOS's state is stored at an address inside a Geth `statedb`, allowing it to inherit the `statedb`'s statefulness and lifetime properties."}
{"question": "What happens to a transaction's direct state changes to ArbOS upon a revert?", "answer": "The direct state changes to ArbOS are discarded upon a revert."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the various hooks used by ArbOS to modify Geth's behavior when processing transactions?", "answer": "Each hook provides an opportunity for ArbOS to update its state and make decisions about the transaction during its lifetime."}
{"question": "Where are the Arbitrum-specific hooks inserted in the callgraph of Geth's `ApplyTransaction` function?", "answer": "The hooks are inserted at various points, including `ReadyEVMForL2`, `StartTxHook`, `GasChargingHook`, `PushCaller`, `ForceRefundGas`, `NonrefundableGas`, and `EndTxHook`."}
{"question": "What is the default behavior of the hooks if `EnableArbOS` is not set to true?", "answer": "By default, these hooks do nothing so as to leave Geth's default behavior unchanged."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the ReadyEVMForL2 hook in the Geth EVM?", "answer": "The ReadyEVMForL2 hook installs other transaction-specific hooks into each Geth EVM right before it performs a state transition."}
{"question": "What happens if the ReadyEVMForL2 call is not made before a state transition in the Geth EVM?", "answer": "If the ReadyEVMForL2 call is not made, the state transition will instead use the default DefaultTxProcessor and get exactly the same results as vanilla Geth."}
{"question": "What are the two Arbitrum-specific transaction types handled by the StartTxHook?", "answer": "The two Arbitrum-specific transaction types handled by the StartTxHook are ArbitrumDepositTx and ArbitrumSubmitRetryableTx."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `GasChargingHook` in ArbOS?", "answer": "The `GasChargingHook` ensures that a user has enough funds to pay for their poster's parent chain calldata costs, and sets aside the amount paid for later reimbursement."}
{"question": "What happens if a user attempts to purchase compute gas in excess of ArbOS's per-block gas limit?", "answer": "The difference is set aside and refunded later via `ForceRefundGas`, so that only the gas limit is used."}
{"question": "Why may the observed gas limit not be the same as that seen at the start of the block in ArbOS?", "answer": "The observed gas limit may not be the same because ArbOS's larger gas pool may fall below the `MaxPerBlockGasLimit` while processing the block's previous transactions."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the PushCaller hook in Arbitrum?", "answer": "The PushCaller hook tracks the callers within the EVM callstack, providing ArbSys with information about the callstack."}
{"question": "How do the L1BlockHash and L1BlockNumber hooks accommodate the normal use-case of BlockHash and Number operations in Arbitrum?", "answer": "The L1BlockHash and L1BlockNumber hooks return data that relies on the underlying parent chain blocks instead of child chain blocks."}
{"question": "What is the function of the ForceRefundGas hook in ArbOS?", "answer": "The ForceRefundGas hook allows ArbOS to add additional refunds to the user's transaction, currently used to refund excess compute gas purchased during the GasChargingHook."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the NonrefundableGas hook in ArbOS?", "answer": "The NonrefundableGas hook provides Geth access to the equivalent amount of child chain gas the poster's cost equals, ensuring this amount is not reimbursed for network-incentivized behaviors like freeing storage slots."}
{"question": "When is the EndTxHook called in the transaction processing flow?", "answer": "The EndTxHook is called after the EVM has returned a transaction's result, allowing one last opportunity for ArbOS to intervene before the state transition is finalized."}
{"question": "What is the role of the APIBackend interface in the Arbitrum system?", "answer": "The APIBackend interface is a component that provides an interface for interacting with the Ethereum API, but its specific role is not detailed in the provided text."}

{"question": "What type of transaction may schedule an ArbitrumRetryTx if provided enough gas, as described in the retryables documentation?", "answer": "ArbitrumSubmitRetryableTx"}
{"question": "Why does ArbOS create transactions of type ArbitrumInternalTx, and what is the purpose of the Type field in such transactions?", "answer": "ArbOS creates ArbitrumInternalTx to update its state in-between user-generated transactions because tracing support requires state-changes to happen inside a transaction, and the Type field is for future-proofing to signify the state it will update."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the InternalTxStartBlock transaction in Nitro?", "answer": "The InternalTxStartBlock transaction updates the parent chain block number and the parent chain base fee whenever a new block is created."}
{"question": "How does Nitro Geth denote the intent behind a message, such as a geth message?", "answer": "Nitro Geth denotes the intent behind a message by means of its TxRunMode, which it sets before processing the message."}
{"question": "What role does the TxRunMode play in ArbOS's decision-making process about a transaction?", "answer": "ArbOS uses the TxRunMode information to make decisions about the transaction that a message ultimately constructs."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between a message and its underlying transaction in the context of OffchainLabs' go-ethereum?", "answer": "A message will carry its underlying transaction in a field accessible via its UnderlyingTransaction method, but they are not one-to-one."}
{"question": "Under what conditions does a message in MessageGasEstimationMode have an underlying transaction?", "answer": "When created via NodeInterface or when scheduled."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the EnableArbos parameter in Nitro's Geth configuration for Arbitrum chain parameters?", "answer": "It introduces ArbOS, converting a vanilla parent chain into an Arbitrum rollup child chain."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `AllowDebugPrecompiles` feature?", "answer": "Allows access to debug precompiles, but when false, calls to debug precompiles will always revert."}
{"question": "How does the `GasMargin` field in `bind.TransactOpts` affect transaction submissions in Vanilla Geth's abi library?", "answer": "It pads estimates by the number of basis points set to account for potential reverts due to slight changes in the transaction's codepath."}
{"question": "What safety precaution does ArbOS implement to conserve child chain ETH, and how does it respond to violations?", "answer": "ArbOS checks Geth's balance delta each time a block is created and alerts or panics should conservation be violated, ensuring the total amount of child chain ether in the system does not change except in controlled cases."}
{"question": "What is stored in the MixDigest and ExtraData fields of each child chain block?", "answer": "The root hash and leaf count of ArbOS's send merkle accumulator"}
{"question": "Why is the first 8 bytes of the MixDigest used to store the send count?", "answer": "Because the ExtraData field may be no larger than 32 bytes, as specified in the yellow paper"}
{"question": "What was added to Geth to support retryables?", "answer": "A ScheduledTxes field to ExecutionResult and a gasEstimation param to DoCall"}
{"question": "What was added to the Message interface in the Arbitrum update?", "answer": "UnderlyingTransaction"}

{"question": "How does Genesis block creation work in nitro, and what is its relation to the traditional block #0?", "answer": "In nitro, the Genesis block is not necessarily block #0, as it supports importing blocks that take place before genesis, allowing for non-zero genesis blocks."}
{"question": "What role does ArbOS play in the Arbitrum ecosystem, and what functions does it perform?", "answer": "ArbOS is a trusted 'system glue' component that facilitates the execution environment of the child chain Arbitrum, managing network resources, producing blocks, handling cross-chain messaging, and operating an instrumented instance of Geth for execution."}
{"question": "What are the advantages of supporting functions in the child chain trusted software rather than building them into the parent chain-enforced rules?", "answer": "The advantages include significant cost savings due to lower computation and storage costs at the child chain, as well as increased flexibility because the child chain code is easier to evolve or customize."}
{"question": "What are precompiles in the context of ArbOS and how do they work?", "answer": "Precompiles are child chain (L2)-specific methods that smart contracts can call, similar to solidity functions. They consist of a solidity interface and a corresponding Golang implementation, and are generated using Geth's ABI generator."}
{"question": "How does the runtime installer ensure type safety for each precompile's implementer in ArbOS?", "answer": "The runtime installer uses a generated file that collects the ABI data of the precompiles to check the type safety of each precompile's implementer, ensuring that the implementation is correct and safe."}
{"question": "How does the installer ensure that each implementer has the correct methods and signatures?", "answer": "The installer uses runtime reflection to verify the methods and signatures of each implementer."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of using precompile wrappers like `ownerOnly` and `debugOnly` during installation?", "answer": "These wrappers restrict a precompile's methods to only be callable by certain entities, such as chain owners or in debug mode."}
{"question": "Why does the system use runtime reflection for calling, dispatching, and recording of precompile methods?", "answer": "This approach avoids human error that could occur with manual parsing and writing of bytes, and utilizes Geth's stable APIs for packing and unpacking values."}
{"question": "What is created each time a transaction calls a method of a child chain-specific precompile?", "answer": "A call context"}
{"question": "What does the call context provide access to?", "answer": "The public fields of the underlying TxProcessor"}
{"question": "Why does the TxProcessor only make certain information public?", "answer": "Because sub-transactions could revert without updates to this struct, so it only makes public that which is safe"}
{"question": "What represents an incoming sequencer message in the context of Arbitrum?", "answer": "An L1IncomingMessage"}
{"question": "What is the relationship between an L1IncomingMessage and a child chain block?", "answer": "The relationship is bijective, meaning for every L1IncomingMessage there is a unique child chain block with a unique child chain block hash, and vice versa."}

{"question": "What is the purpose of tracking the parent chain data fee in ArbOS?", "answer": "To determine how much transactions will be charged for parent chain fees, with the goal of making fees collected approximately equal to batch posting costs over time."}
{"question": "What is the primary mechanism used by the child chain pricing state to determine a reasonable child chain gas price?", "answer": "A pair of pools, one larger than the other, that drain as child chain-specific resources are consumed and filled as time passes."}
{"question": "How does the child chain pricing state account for parent chain-specific resources like calldata?", "answer": "Parent chain-specific resources like calldata are not tracked by the pools, as they have little bearing on the actual work done by the network actors that the speed limit is meant to keep stable and synced."}
{"question": "At what point in the process does the pricing mechanism receive information about the time that's passed?", "answer": "After each of an incoming message's transactions removes from the pool the parent chain component of the gas it uses, and the message's timestamp informs the pricing mechanism of the time that's passed as ArbOS finalizes the block."}
{"question": "What determines the per-block gas limit in ArbOS?", "answer": "ArbOS's larger gas pool determines the per-block gas limit."}
{"question": "Why is a per-block gas limit necessary in Arbitrum?", "answer": "The per-block gas limit is necessary because Arbitrator WAVM execution is much slower than native transaction execution, which means that there can only be so much gas (wall-clock time) in a child chain block."}
{"question": "How does ArbOS handle the first transaction in a block to improve user experience?", "answer": "For the first transaction, ArbOS enforces the gas limit in the GasChargingHook to avoid sharp decreases in the parent chain gas price, allowing the first transaction to succeed rather than requiring a resubmission."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of ArbOS's per-block gas limit?", "answer": "To constrain the amount of work done per block, which is distinct from Geth's block limit."}
{"question": "Why does ArbOS use the same Geth gas pool for a block's transactions?", "answer": "To maintain the invariant that the pool decreases monotonically after each transaction."}
{"question": "What is the role of the `gasLeft` variable in ArbOS?", "answer": "To keep child chain blocks from exceeding ArbOS's per-block gas limit and to deduct space in situations where the state transition failed or used negligible amounts of compute gas."}
{"question": "What happens when two or more proposers are bonded on sibling assertions in the Rollup chain?", "answer": "A challenge begins between all of them, with the Rollup protocol recording and refereeing the challenge, eventually declaring a winner and confiscating the losers' bonds."}
{"question": "What is the goal of the challenge game in the context of Arbitrum's BoLD protocol?", "answer": "The goal of the system is to determine which assertion corresponds to the correct execution."}
{"question": "What is the consequence for the losers in a challenge between proposers bonded on sibling assertions?", "answer": "The losers will be removed as proposers and their bonds will be confiscated."}
{"question": "What are the two phases of operation for the game?", "answer": "Bisection and one-step proof"}

{"question": "How many rounds does it take for Alice and Bob to disagree about a single step of execution using the bisection method?", "answer": "A logarithmic number of rounds."}
{"question": "What are the two conditions that define the correctness of the simplified protocol?", "answer": "(1) If Alice's initial claim is correct, Alice can always win the challenge, and (2) if Alice's initial claim is incorrect and there is at least one honest validator, Alice and her allies never win the challenge."}
{"question": "What happens if Alice's initial claim is correct in the simplified bisection protocol?", "answer": "Alice will be defending a correct claim at each stage, and she can win the challenge by proving her one-step claim."}
{"question": "How does Bob force Alice to defend an incorrect claim if her initial claim is incorrect in the simplified bisection protocol?", "answer": "Bob can challenge either half-size claim, and since one of them must be incorrect, he will be able to identify and challenge an incorrect claim at each stage."}
{"question": "What resource is available for those seeking a more mathematically precise explanation of the BoLD protocol?", "answer": "The BoLD research whitepaper, which can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491."}
{"question": "What is the process of bisection used for in the context of Layer 2 Nitro blocks and WAVM instructions?", "answer": "The process of bisection is used to narrow down a dispute to a single instruction, first over Layer 2 blocks, then over 'big steps' of many instructions, and finally over single WAVM instructions."}
{"question": "How does the protocol track time for each assertion, and what is the purpose of the time allowance?", "answer": "The protocol tracks a timer for each assertion, counting how much time has passed while that assertion could be seen as the presumptive winner of the game. The time allowance, designed to be about a week, gives honest parties enough time to act and accounts for possible censorship on L1."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the recursive bisection sub-protocol in the context of WAVM instructions?", "answer": "The recursive bisection sub-protocol is used to narrow down a dispute to a single instruction, by executing the sub-protocol again over WAVM instructions."}
{"question": "What is the primary goal of the challenge protocol in terms of work required by the protocol?", "answer": "To resolve disputes with a minimum of work required by the protocol"}
{"question": "At what point does the protocol need to evaluate a move 'on the merits' and determine its validity?", "answer": "At the one-step proof, where it needs to verify that the provided proof establishes the correct state transition of the virtual machine"}
{"question": "What is the role of the ChallengeManager in the context of challenge games?", "answer": "The ChallengeManager plays the role of the arbiter of challenge games"}
{"question": "What is the process of narrowing down a dispute in the challenge manager?", "answer": "The dispute is narrowed down by bisecting over global states, including block hashes, until it reaches an individual block."}
{"question": "How does the 'big-step' execution challenge operate?", "answer": "It operates by bisecting the machine execution until a 'chunk' of 2^26 WASM instructions is reached, and then proceeds with a 'small-step' execution challenge."}
{"question": "What is required to resolve a one-step dispute in the 'small-step' execution challenge?", "answer": "A player must provide proof data to execute a step of the machine, which is checked on L1, and if correct, confirms the one-step edge to which the proof is applied."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of delaying the winning of a challenge?", "answer": "The delay serves as a precaution to allow time for diagnosing and fixing potential errors with a contract upgrade in case the challenge is resolved incorrectly."}
{"question": "What are One Step Proof Assumptions (OSP) used for?", "answer": "One Step Proof Assumptions (OSP) document and make certain assumptions about the cases that can arise during a correct execution."}
{"question": "How does OSP handle unreachable cases in correct execution?", "answer": "In unreachable cases, OSP can implement any instruction semantics since these cases are assumed to never arise in correct execution."}
{"question": "What happens when a case is considered 'unreachable' in the OSP implementation?", "answer": "The OSP can implement any instruction semantics in that case."}
{"question": "How should the challenge protocol behave when dealing with assertions that start from an unreachable machine state?", "answer": "The challenge protocol must do something safe in every case, even if the instruction semantics can be weird in such cases."}
{"question": "What is the potential consequence of an undetectable unreachable case being reached in correct execution?", "answer": "It could lead to a security failure."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of WAVM code generated by Arbitrator from valid WASM?", "answer": "The WAVM code is used for proving and is assumed to never encounter an unreachable case."}
{"question": "What is the maximum allowed size of inbox messages, and why is it limited?", "answer": "The maximum allowed size of inbox messages is 117,964 bytes, which is 90% of the max transaction size Geth will accept, to prevent it from being too large for proving."}
{"question": "What are the conditions under which a requested preimage can be resolved by WAVM's opcode?", "answer": "The preimage must be already known to all nodes and not too long, otherwise, violations of this assumption are undetectable by the OSP checker."}
{"question": "What is the current length limit in bytes for Nitro requests?", "answer": "117,964 bytes"}
{"question": "Why does Nitro need to request previous block headers, and how many can it request?", "answer": "Nitro needs previous block headers to implement the BLOCKHASH EVM instruction and determine the current state; it can request up to the last 256 headers."}
{"question": "How are WASM instructions that are not 1:1 with WAVM opcodes handled during transpilation?", "answer": "They are expressed in WAVM using custom opcodes not in WASM, which are documented in wavm-custom-opcodes, and branch instructions are replaced with jumps to the corresponding block's destination."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `if` and `else` statements in programming?", "answer": "The `if` and `else` statements are used for conditional execution of code, allowing the program to make decisions based on certain conditions."}
{"question": "How are `if` and `else` statements translated into a block in terms of control flow?", "answer": "They are translated into a block with an `ArbitraryJumpIf`, which includes a conditional jump to the `else` clause, followed by the instructions inside the `if` statement, a branch, and finally the instructions inside the `else` statement."}
{"question": "What is the role of `ArbitraryJumpIf` in the translation of `if` and `else` statements?", "answer": "`ArbitraryJumpIf` is used to represent the conditional jump to the `else` clause, allowing for the execution of different blocks of code based on the condition."}
{"question": "How are `br` and `br_if` instructions translated?", "answer": "They are translated into `ArbitraryJump` and `ArbitraryJumpIf` respectively, with jump locations known at transpilation time."}
{"question": "What is the process for translating a `return` instruction?", "answer": "The number of return values is determined from the function signature, then WAVM `MoveFromStackToInternal` and `MoveFromInternalToStack` are used to handle return values, and finally a WAVM `Return` is added."}
{"question": "How are floating point instructions translated?", "answer": "A floating point library module must be present; arguments are bitcasted to integers, a cross-module call to the library is made, and return values are bitcasted back to floating point numbers."}
{"question": "What additional WASM proposals are implemented by WAVM?", "answer": "WAVM implements the multi-value and sign extension ops WASM proposals."}
{"question": "What happens when the invariants for opcodes, such as 'Pops an i32 from the stack', are not satisfied?", "answer": "Execution is generally not possible if these conditions are not satisfied."}
{"question": "How is the WAVM `return` opcode handled in terms of stack cleanup?", "answer": "The WAVM `return` opcode does not clean up the stack by itself, but its WASM->WAVM codegen includes a loop that utilizes `IsStackBoundary` to perform the stack cleanup specified for WASM's `return`."}
{"question": "What happens when the opcode 0x8004 is executed?", "answer": "Pops an i32 from the stack and jumps to the program counter in the argument data if the value is non-zero."}
{"question": "How does the opcode 0x8009 handle module linking?", "answer": "Pushes the current program counter, module number, and module's internals offset to the stack, then jumps to the beginning of a function specified by the argument data."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the opcode 0x800A in host calls?", "answer": "Used for the implementation of all wavm_caller_* host calls, which can be invoked from libraries."}
{"question": "What happens when the CallerModuleInternalCall opcode (0x800A) is executed and the caller module internals offset is 0?", "answer": "It errors."}
{"question": "Under what conditions will the GetGlobalStateBytes32 opcode (0x8010) error?", "answer": "If the index is greater than or equal to the number of global state bytes32s, if the pointer mod 32 is not zero, or if the pointer + 32 is outside the program's memory."}
{"question": "What does the SetGlobalStateBytes32 opcode (0x8011) do with the value read from the specified pointer in memory?", "answer": "It sets the global state bytes32 value of the specified index to it."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the SetGlobalStateU64 instruction, and what are the conditions under which it will error?", "answer": "The SetGlobalStateU64 instruction sets the global state u64 value of a specified index to a u64 read from a pointer in memory. It will error if the index is out of range, the pointer is not aligned to 32 bytes, or the pointer + 8 is outside the program's memory."}
{"question": "How does the ReadPreImage instruction handle reading and writing preimage data, and what are the potential errors that can occur?", "answer": "The ReadPreImage instruction reads a Keccak-256 hash from a pointer in memory and writes up to 32 bytes of the preimage to that hash. It will error if the pointer is not aligned to 32 bytes or if the pointer + 32 is outside the program's memory."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the HaltAndSetFinished instruction, and what effect does it have on the machine status?", "answer": "The HaltAndSetFinished instruction sets the machine status to finished, halting execution and marking it as a success. It effectively terminates the program's execution."}
{"question": "Why is implementing correct floating point operations directly in WAVM a tricky endeavor?", "answer": "Because WASM specifies floating point operations as being compliant to IEEE 754-2019, which is not deterministic and has many edge cases."}
{"question": "How are floating point operations implemented in WAVM to ensure determinism and consistency?", "answer": "By using the C Berkeley SoftFloat-3e library, which runs inside WAVM, and replacing float point operations with cross module calls to the library."}
{"question": "What is a notable limitation of the Berkeley SoftFloat library used in WAVM?", "answer": "The library does not implement all necessary floating point operations, such as the min function, despite it being specified in IEEE 754-2019."}
{"question": "What happens when floating point to integer truncation overflows in WAVM, and how does it differ from the standard WASM behavior?", "answer": "In WAVM, floating point to integer truncation will saturate on overflow, instead of erroring, which is generally safer than the undefined result produced by overflowing on x86."}
{"question": "How do modules interact with each other in WAVM, and what is the role of the entrypoint module?", "answer": "In WAVM, multiple modules can be combined to form an executing program, where they may call each other and library modules can write to their caller's memory to return results. The entrypoint module initiates execution, calls modules' start functions if specified, and then calls the main module's main function."}
{"question": "How do libraries export functions in WAVM, and what is the naming pattern used for exported functions?", "answer": "Libraries in WAVM may export functions using the name pattern `module__name`, which can be imported by future libraries or the main module as `module` `name`, allowing for functionality like wasi-stub to provide functions according to the WebAssembly System Interface."}
{"question": "How do future libraries use floating point operations provided by the soft float library?", "answer": "Future modules can implicitly use these by using WASM floating point operations, which are replaced at the WASM->WAVM level with bitcasts and cross module calls to these functions."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `wavm_guest_call__*` functions in libraries?", "answer": "Libraries may call the main module's exports via `env` `wavm_guest_call__*`, allowing them to interact with the main module, such as calling Go's resume function or retrieving the new stack pointer."}
{"question": "How do libraries access their caller's memory in WAVM?", "answer": "Libraries can access their caller's memory via `wavm_caller_{load,store}{8,32}`, which calls internal functions of the caller's module that perform a memory load or store of 1 or 4 bytes."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of bridging from a parent chain to a child chain in the context of Arbitrum?", "answer": "Bridging from a parent chain to a child chain allows users to submit transactions, deposit native tokens or ETH, and send arbitrary data or instructions from the parent chain to the child chain."}
{"question": "What are the different methods of parent-to-child chain messaging in Arbitrum?", "answer": "The methods include native token bridging (such as ETH bridging and custom gas token bridging), transaction via the delayed inbox (including unsigned and signed messages), and retryable tickets."}
{"question": "What is the function of retryable tickets in Arbitrum's parent-to-child chain messaging?", "answer": "Retryable tickets are Arbitrum's canonical mechanism for creating parent-to-child messages, allowing transactions initiated on a parent chain to trigger execution on a child chain."}
{"question": "What are the two categories of messaging for sending arbitrary data or calls from a parent-to-child chain?", "answer": "General retryable messaging and Customized feature messaging"}
{"question": "How can users deposit tokens, such as ETH, from a parent chain to a child chain in Arbitrum chains?", "answer": "Users can deposit tokens by calling the Inbox contract's depositEth method or using the chain's delayed inbox contract for custom gas tokens."}
{"question": "What type of token can Arbitrum chains use as their gas fee currency, and what is an example of a custom gas token used by some Orbit chains?", "answer": "Arbitrum chains can use ETH or any other ERC-20 token as their gas fee currency, and some Orbit chains opt for a custom gas token, details of which can be found in the Custom gas token SDK."}
{"question": "What happens when you deposit ETH directly via depositEth to a contract on a child chain?", "answer": "It will not invoke that contract's fallback function."}
{"question": "How does the deposit process work when calling Inbox.depositEth?", "answer": "The ETH is sent to the contract on the parent chain, which then credits the deposited amount to the specified address on the child chain."}
{"question": "What is address aliasing in the context of the delayed inbox and how is it calculated?", "answer": "Address aliasing is when unsigned messages submitted through the delayed inbox have their sender addresses aliased when executed on the child chain, calculated as Child_Alias = Parent_Contract_Address + 0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of address aliasing in Arbitrum?", "answer": "Address aliasing in Arbitrum is a security measure that prevents cross-chain exploits by introducing an offset to distinguish between parent-chain contract calls and those from child-chain-native addresses."}
{"question": "How can you recover the original parent chain address from an aliased child chain address onchain?", "answer": "You can use Arbitrum's `AddressAliasHelper` library to translate between the aliased child address and the original parent address in your contract logic."}
{"question": "What is the role of the `onlyFromMyL1Contract` modifier in contract logic?", "answer": "The `onlyFromMyL1Contract` modifier checks if the message sender is the original parent chain address by using `AddressAliasHelper.undoL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender)` to undo the aliasing and verify it matches the expected `myL1ContractAddress`."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the delayed inbox contract on the parent chain in Arbitrum?", "answer": "The delayed inbox contract allows parent chain EOAs or contracts to send messages or transactions to a child chain, enabling general cross-chain messaging and censorship resistance."}
{"question": "How can users send child chain transactions through the delayed inbox in Arbitrum?", "answer": "Users can send child chain transactions through the delayed inbox in two primary ways: general child chain messaging and retryable tickets."}
{"question": "What is the difference between signed and unsigned messages sent via the delayed inbox in Arbitrum?", "answer": "Signed messages are signed by an EOA on the parent chain, proving the sender's identity, while unsigned messages do not include a signature and require address aliasing for security reasons."}
{"question": "What is the primary purpose of signed messages in the context of delayed inbox methods?", "answer": "To allow a parent chain EOA to prove ownership of an address and ensure that child chain transactions are executed with the signer's address, rather than an alias."}
{"question": "Under what circumstances is it beneficial to use signed messages to bypass the Sequencer?", "answer": "When you want to force-include a transaction on a child chain in case of Sequencer downtime or censorship, or when you need an operation on a child chain that explicitly requires EOA authorization."}
{"question": "What is the role of the `sendL2Message` function in sending signed messages through the delayed inbox?", "answer": "It can be called by either an EOA or a contract, emits the complete signed transaction data in an event log for nodes to reconstruct the transaction without replaying it, and provides more flexibility."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the sendL2MessageFromOrigin function and what are its key characteristics?", "answer": "The sendL2MessageFromOrigin function allows a 'codeless origin' EOA to send a message, offering lower gas costs due to not emitting large event logs, with the signed transaction retrieved directly from calldata."}
{"question": "How do unsigned messages differ from standard transactions in terms of sender verification and what are the implications?", "answer": "Unsigned messages do not require an EOA signature but instead rely on the sender's address being aliased on the child chain for verification, which is crucial for security and functionality."}
{"question": "What are the main differences between sendL1FundedUnsignedTransaction and sendUnsignedTransaction in terms of value transfer and transaction fees?", "answer": "The sendL1FundedUnsignedTransaction transfers value from a parent chain to a child chain along with the transaction, while sendUnsignedTransaction does not transfer value from the parent chain, relying on the child chain balance for transaction fees and value."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of using a contract's existing child chain balance in the `sendContractTransaction` function?", "answer": "To send a transaction from a parent chain with no new funds."}
{"question": "How does the `sendL1FundedContractTransaction` function differ from the `sendContractTransaction` function?", "answer": "It sends the transaction and transfers additional funds from a parent to child chain."}
{"question": "What are the parameters required for the `sendContractTransaction` function?", "answer": "The function requires gasLimit, maxFeePerGas, to, value, and data as parameters."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of creating a 'delayed message' in the parent chain bridge contract?", "answer": "To arrange its inclusion on a child chain."}
{"question": "How do retryable tickets provide atomicity between cross-chain operations?", "answer": "If the parent chain transaction to request submission succeeds, then the execution of the retryable on the child chain has a strong guarantee to succeed."}
{"question": "What is the mechanism that ensures a parent chain contract can't impersonate a child chain address unless it provides a valid signature as an EOA?", "answer": "Address aliasing"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `createRetryableTicket` function in the `inbox` contract?", "answer": "The purpose of the `createRetryableTicket` function is to initiate the creation of a retryable ticket, which is guaranteed to get created if the call succeeds."}
{"question": "What are the parameters that need to be adjusted with care when calling the `createRetryableTicket` function?", "answer": "The parameters that need to be adjusted with care include `l1CallValue`, `address to`, `uint256 l2CallValue`, `uint256 maxSubmissionCost`, `address excessFeeRefundAddress`, and `address callValueRefundAddress`."}
{"question": "How is the excess deposit transferred when calling the `createRetryableTicket` function?", "answer": "The excess deposit will transfer to the alias address of the parent chain tx's `msg.sender` rather than the specified `excessFeeRefundAddress`, according to the formula: `(gasLimit x maxFeePerGas - execution cost) + (maxSubmission - (autoredeem ? 0 : submission cost))`."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the callValueRefundAddress in the context of ticket creation?", "answer": "The callValueRefundAddress is the child chain address to which the l2CallValue is credited if the ticket times out or gets canceled."}
{"question": "What conditions must be met for a new ticket to be created and added to the retryable buffer?", "answer": "The sender's deposit must be enough to make the parent chain submission succeed and for child chain execution to be attempted, and the provided data must be correct."}
{"question": "What happens to the user's funds when a ticket is created and added to the retryable buffer?", "answer": "Funds (l2CallValue + submissionCost) get deducted from the user and are placed into escrow on the child chain for later use in redeeming the ticket."}
{"question": "What are the conditions for a ticket to be executed on the child chain after successful creation on the parent chain?", "answer": "The user's child chain balance must be greater than or equal to `maxFeePerGas * gasLimit` and the `maxFeePerGas` provided by the user must be greater than or equal to the `l2BaseFee`."}
{"question": "What happens if a ticket is successfully auto-redeemed on the child chain?", "answer": "The ticket will execute with the original submission's sender, destination, callvalue, and calldata, and the submission fee will be refunded to the user on the child chain (`excessFeeRefundAddress`)."}
{"question": "How can one ensure successful auto-redeem of a ticket on the child chain?", "answer": "One can use the Arbitrum SDK, which provides a convenience function that returns the desired gas parameters when sending parent-to-child messages."}
{"question": "What happens if a 'redeem' is not done at submission or the submission's initial 'redeem' fails?", "answer": "The submission fee is collected on the child chain to cover the resources required to temporarily keep the ticket in memory for a fixed period (one week), and a manual redemption of the ticket is required."}
{"question": "What are the conditions for an auto-'redeem' to succeed?", "answer": "The user's child chain balance must be greater than (or equal to) 'maxFeePerGas * gasLimit' and 'maxFeePerGas' must be greater than (or equal to) the 'l2BaseFee'."}
{"question": "What happens when a ticket is executed and the auto-'redeem' succeeds?", "answer": "The actual 'submissionFee' is refunded to the 'excessFeeRefundAddress', the ticket is deleted from the child chain retryable buffer, and the 'callValueRefundAddress' is refunded with ('maxGas - gasUsed) * gasPrice'."}
{"question": "What happens to a ticket if it is not manually redeemed within seven days?", "answer": "The ticket expires and will be automatically discarded, unless some party has paid a fee to keep the ticket alive for another full period."}
{"question": "How does the gas limit affect the manual redemption of a ticket?", "answer": "The amount of gas is not limited by the original gasLimit set during the ticket creation, and instead comes from the call to redeem, so there's no chance to reach the block's gas limit before execution."}
{"question": "What happens to a ticket after it is manually redeemed?", "answer": "The ticket is deleted from the child chain retryable buffer after a successful manual redemption."}
{"question": "What happens to the escrowed callValue when a ticket is redeemed successfully?", "answer": "The To address receives the escrowed callValue."}
{"question": "Can a ticket be canceled or rescheduled while it is being redeemed?", "answer": "No, attempts to cancel or schedule another redeem of the same ticket will revert during ticket redemption."}
{"question": "What happens to the escrowed callValue if a ticket with a callValue is eventually discarded without successfully running?", "answer": "The escrowed callValue will be paid out to a callValueRefundAddress account that was specified in the initial submission."}
{"question": "What two types of child chain transaction receipts are emitted in the lifecycle of a retryable ticket?", "answer": "Ticket creation receipt and redeem attempt receipt"}
{"question": "What event is included in the ticket creation receipt, and what field does it contain?", "answer": "The TicketCreated event from ArbRetryableTx, which includes a ticketId field"}
{"question": "Under what conditions will only one successful redeem attempt receipt ever exist for a given ticket?", "answer": "If the auto-redeem upon initial creation succeeds, or if at most one successful redeem attempt can ever exist for a given ticket"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the sanity checks in the Inbox.createRetryableTicket convenience method?", "answer": "To minimize the risk of user error by ensuring enough funds are provided directly from a parent chain to cover the current cost of ticket creation."}
{"question": "What is the difference between the Inbox.createRetryableTicket and Inbox.unsafeCreateRetryableTicket methods?", "answer": "The Inbox.createRetryableTicket method includes sanity checks, while the Inbox.unsafeCreateRetryableTicket method bypasses these checks and should only be used by power-users who know what they are doing."}
{"question": "How does Arbitrum's canonical token bridge provide a seamless user experience for transferring assets from a parent-to-child chain?", "answer": "By leveraging retryable tickets under the hood, allowing for customized feature messaging and providing a seamless user experience for transferring assets."}
{"question": "What is the primary bridge recommended for users and applications to use on the Arbitrum protocol?", "answer": "The canonical bridge implemented by Offchain Labs"}
{"question": "How does the token bridging system facilitate cross-domain asset transfers on the Arbitrum protocol?", "answer": "Through a pair of contracts on two different domains, known as gateways, that leverage Arbitrum's cross-chain message passing system"}
{"question": "What happens when a user deposits an ERC-20 token using the standard bridging functionality on the Arbitrum protocol?", "answer": "The tokens are escrowed in a parent chain bridge contract and the same amount of paired tokens are minted on the child chain"}
{"question": "What is the main challenge with tokens that accrue interest to their holders in a cross-layer system?", "answer": "The interest must be dispersed properly across layers and not simply accrue to the bridge contracts."}
{"question": "Why is it important to have a canonical child chain representation per parent chain token contract?", "answer": "To avoid a situation where a single parent chain token can be represented at multiple addresses/contracts on the child chain, which adds significant friction and confusion for users and developers."}
{"question": "What are the three types of contracts that make up the token-bridging architecture?", "answer": "Asset contracts, Gateways, and Routers."}
{"question": "What is the role of the L1GatewayRouter contract in the token transfer process?", "answer": "The L1GatewayRouter contract is responsible for mapping the parent chain token addresses to L1Gateway contracts, thus acting as a parent/child address oracle and ensuring each token corresponds to only one gateway."}
{"question": "How do gateways communicate with their counterparts on the child chain?", "answer": "Gateways typically communicate with their counterparts on the child chain via retryable tickets."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the StandardERC20Gateway, and how can it be used?", "answer": "The StandardERC20Gateway allows any ERC-20 token on a parent chain not registered to a gateway to be permissionlessly bridged through it by default, and users can bridge tokens via this gateway using the bridge UI or following instructions in the provided guide."}
{"question": "What is the first step in depositing SomeERC20Token via the standard ERC-20 gateway?", "answer": "A user calls L1GatewayRouter.outboundTransferCustomRefund with SomeERC20Token's parent chain address as an argument."}
{"question": "How does L1ERC20Gateway handle the tokens sent during the deposit process?", "answer": "L1ERC20Gateway escrows the tokens sent and creates a retryable ticket to trigger L2ERC20Gateway's finalizeInboundTransfer method on the child chain."}
{"question": "What contract is responsible for minting the appropriate token amount on the child chain during the deposit process?", "answer": "L2ERC20Gateway.finalizeInboundTransfer mints the appropriate token amount at the arbSomeERC20Token contract on the child chain, which is an instance of StandardArbERC20."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the Arbitrum generic-custom gateway?", "answer": "The Arbitrum generic-custom gateway is designed to be flexible enough to suit most custom fungible token needs, allowing tokens with requirements beyond the standard ERC-20 gateway to be bridged without requiring a unique, tailor-made gateway."}
{"question": "When is a special gateway required for a custom token?", "answer": "A special gateway is likely required if the custom token can increase its supply (i.e., mint) directly on the child chain and the child-chain-minted tokens need to be withdrawable back to the parent chain and recognized by the parent chain contract."}
{"question": "What are some examples of token features that are suitable for the generic-custom gateway?", "answer": "Some examples include a child chain token contract upgradable via a proxy, a child chain token contract that includes address whitelisting/blacklisting, and the deployer determining the address of the child chain token contract."}
{"question": "What interface should my token on the parent chain conform to?", "answer": "ICustomToken"}
{"question": "What methods are required for a token to conform to the IArbToken interface on the child chain?", "answer": "bridgeMint and bridgeBurn methods, which should only be callable by the L2CustomGateway contract"}
{"question": "Why is it recommended to keep the implementation of the IArbToken interface close to the L2GatewayToken example implementation?", "answer": "To ensure token compatibility with available tooling, such as the Arbitrum bridge, and to avoid issues with withdrawal through the UI"}
{"question": "How do I register my token on the parent chain to the child chain?", "answer": "You can register your token by having your parent chain token's contract make an external call to `L1CustomGateway.registerTokenToL2`, or submit a chain-owner registration via an Arbitrum DAO proposal."}
{"question": "What is the next step after registering my token to the generic-custom gateway?", "answer": "After your token's registration to the generic-custom gateway is complete, have your parent chain token's contract make an external call to `L1GatewayRouter.setGateway`, or submit a chain-owner registration via an Arbitrum DAO proposal."}
{"question": "How does the wrapped Ether implementation work with the parent/child gateway architecture?", "answer": "The parent/child gateway architecture unwraps the `WETH` on domain A, transfers the now-unwrapped Ether, and re-wraps it on domain B, ensuring that `WETH` can behave on the child chain as expected while keeping all `WETH` tokens fully collateralized."}
{"question": "What is the role of a gateway in accommodating complex token bridging needs within a canonical bridging system?", "answer": "A gateway can be created to accommodate any particular token's bridging needs, no matter the complexity."}
{"question": "Where can one find information on implementing a custom gateway for token bridging?", "answer": "Information on implementing a custom gateway can be found on the page 'How to bridge tokens via a custom gateway'."}
{"question": "What precautions should users take when using non-canonical bridge applications for cross-chain bridging?", "answer": "Users should exercise caution and do their due diligence before entrusting non-canonical bridge applications with their value, as they can potentially be insecure or scams."}
{"question": "How do child chain-to-parent chain messages work in Arbitrum's system?", "answer": "Child chain-to-parent chain messages, also known as 'outgoing' messages, allow for arbitrary contract calls from the child chain to the parent chain, bearing similarities with Parent chain-to-child chain messages (Retryables) but with some differences."}
{"question": "What is the role of the Outbox contract in the protocol flow of L2 to L1 messaging?", "answer": "The Outbox contract posts the Merkle root of all child chain-to-parent chain messages on the parent chain, lets users execute their messages by validating Merkle proofs of inclusion, and tracks which messages have already been spent."}
{"question": "How does a client execute a child to parent chain message in Arbitrum's system?", "answer": "A client executes a child to parent chain message by first calling the `sendTxToL1` method on the child chain's ArbSys precompile contract, then retrieving proof data via the NodeInterface contract's `constructOutboxProof` method, and finally using this data in the Outbox's `executeTransaction` method to perform parent chain execution."}
{"question": "What is the main goal achieved by requiring `confirmNode` to only update the constant-sized outgoing message root hash?", "answer": "The main goal is to ensure that the cost of confirming nodes remains constant, regardless of the number of outgoing messages or their gas cost on the parent chain."}
{"question": "Why can't outgoing messages provide automatic parent chain execution like Retryables?", "answer": "Outgoing messages can't provide in-protocol automatic parent chain execution because Ethereum itself doesn't offer scheduled execution affordances."}
{"question": "What is the fundamental reason for the week-long delay period before outgoing messages can be executed on Arbitrum rollup?", "answer": "The delay period allows time for Arbitrum validators to detect and prove fault if needed, after a message is published on-chain, before Ethereum accepts its result."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of referring to `NodeInterface` as a 'virtual' contract?", "answer": "To provide a way to access its methods via calls, while not actually living on chain."}
{"question": "How does `NodeInterface` behave in relation to other contracts?", "answer": "It behaves like a precompile that can't receive calls from other contracts."}
{"question": "What is the benefit of using `NodeInterface` as a 'virtual' contract?", "answer": "It allows providing Arbitrum-specific data without having to implement a custom RPC."}
{"question": "What does it mean for Arbitrum to be a Rollup?", "answer": "It means that all inputs to the chain, or messages put into the inbox, are recorded on a parent chain (such as the Ethereum chain) as calldata or blobs."}
{"question": "How can users determine the current correct state of the Arbitrum chain?", "answer": "Users can reconstruct the state of the chain based only on public information by using the full history of the inbox, since the results are uniquely determined by the inbox history."}
{"question": "What is a benefit of the transparent nature of the Arbitrum protocol's history and state?", "answer": "It allows anyone to be a full participant in the protocol, to run an Arbitrum node or participate as a validator, without anything about the history or state of the chain being a secret."}
{"question": "What is the main advantage of Arbitrum chains being Optimistic?", "answer": "The main advantage is that it allows anyone to participate in the protocol and advances the state of its chain by letting any party post an assertion that can be challenged by others."}
{"question": "How does the dispute resolution protocol work in Arbitrum chains?", "answer": "If a claim is challenged during the challenge period, the protocol identifies which party is lying and forfeits their bonds, rewarding the truth-teller(s) with part of the deposit."}
{"question": "What happens to a party who tries to cheat in the Arbitrum protocol?", "answer": "The party who tries to cheat will lose their deposit, making attempts to cheat very rare, and the normal case will be a single party posting a correct assertion with no challenges."}
{"question": "What are the two main choices for resolving disputes in optimistic rollups?", "answer": "Interactive proving or re-executing transactions"}
{"question": "How do Zero-knowledge Rollups avoid disputes related to transaction results?", "answer": "By using ZK proofs to prove directly to the parent chain that the posted result is correct"}
{"question": "What is the basic idea behind interactive proving in dispute resolution?", "answer": "An 'all-vs-all' challenge game between parties with different assertions, refereed by a contract on the parent chain"}
{"question": "What is the fundamental principle behind Arbitrum's approach to dispute resolution?", "answer": "The fundamental principle is based on the bisection of the dispute, where claims are recursively divided in half until a single execution step is disputed."}
{"question": "How does the parent chain referee resolve disputes in Arbitrum's protocol?", "answer": "The parent chain referee only needs to resolve disputes once they are narrowed down to a single execution step, by examining the instruction and determining whether Alice's claim about it is correct."}
{"question": "What is the key principle behind interactive proving in Arbitrum's dispute resolution protocol?", "answer": "The key principle is that if Alice and Bob are in a dispute, they should do as much off-chain work as possible to resolve their dispute, rather than putting that work onto a parent chain contract."}
{"question": "What is the main advantage of interactive proving in the optimistic case?", "answer": "It can resolve disputes larger than one transaction and allow an assertion to contain only a single claim about the end state of the chain after all of the execution covered by the block, resulting in a more efficient computational footprint on the parent chain."}
{"question": "How does interactive proving handle disputes in the pessimistic case?", "answer": "Interactive proving only requires the referee contract on the parent chain to check that the actions have the right shape, without evaluating the correctness of the claims, and only one instruction needs to be re-executed."}
{"question": "What is the key difference between interactive proving and re-execution in terms of computational efficiency?", "answer": "Re-execution requires posting a state claim for each transaction within the assertion and emulating the execution of an entire transaction, whereas interactive proving can resolve disputes with a single claim and only one instruction needing to be re-executed."}
{"question": "What is the main advantage of interactive proving in terms of gas limits?", "answer": "Interactive proving can escape from Ethereum's tight per-transaction gas limit and allow for a higher gas limit."}
{"question": "How does interactive proving provide more implementation flexibility compared to re-execution approaches?", "answer": "Interactive proving allows more flexibility in implementation because it only requires the ability to verify a one-step proof on the parent chain, Ethereum, whereas re-execution approaches are limited by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)."}
{"question": "What drives the design of Arbitrum and how can it be used to understand its features?", "answer": "The design of Arbitrum is driven by the opportunities opened up by interactive proving, and asking how a feature supports or takes advantage of interactive proving can help answer most 'why' questions about Arbitrum."}
{"question": "Do Arbitrum users or developers need to understand the Rollup protocol?", "answer": "No, they don't need to understand the Rollup protocol unless they want to."}
{"question": "What is the role of the Rollup protocol in determining transaction results?", "answer": "The Rollup protocol doesn't decide the results of transactions, it only confirms the results."}
{"question": "When are the results of a transaction knowable in the Arbitrum network?", "answer": "Once your transaction message is in the chain's inbox, its result is knowable."}
{"question": "What is the primary purpose of the Rollup protocol in a child chain scaling system like Arbitrum?", "answer": "The Rollup protocol exists to provide a definitive way to confirm transaction results and prevent lying about these results, as well as to enable Ethereum to know and rely on these confirmed results."}
{"question": "What role do validators play in the Rollup protocol, and how can they participate?", "answer": "Validators participate in the protocol by choosing to be proposers or watchtower validators; proposers place a deposit to ensure honest behavior, while watchtower validators monitor the chain without taking on-chain actions, with roles made permissionless through protocols like BoLD."}
{"question": "What is the key security property of the Rollup protocol that ensures trustlessness in transaction execution?", "answer": "The key security property is that any one honest validator can force the correct execution of the chain to be confirmed, making the execution as trustless as Ethereum and allowing individuals to ensure their transactions are processed correctly regardless of malicious attempts to stop them."}
{"question": "What is the Rollup Chain and how does it differ from the parent chain Ethereum blocks and child chain Nitro blocks?", "answer": "The Rollup Chain is a separate chain that tracks a series of assertions, which are not the same as Ethereum blocks or Nitro blocks, and is managed and overseen by validators."}
{"question": "What information does each assertion in the Rollup Chain contain, and what is the role of the proposer in creating these assertions?", "answer": "Each assertion contains the assertion number, predecessor assertion number, number of child chain blocks, number of inbox messages consumed, and a hash of outputs produced, all of which are claims made by the proposer that may be confirmed or rejected by the protocol."}
{"question": "How do validators and proposers interact with the Rollup Chain, and what are their respective roles in validating transactions and asserting or challenging the chain state?", "answer": "Validators validate transactions by computing the next chain state using the State Transition Function (STF), while proposers can assert and challenge the chain state on the parent chain, serving different roles in maintaining the integrity of the Rollup Chain."}
{"question": "What does an assertion implicitly claim about its predecessor and ancestor assertions?", "answer": "An assertion implicitly claims that its predecessor assertion is correct and, transitively, that it also claims the correctness of a complete history of the chain, reaching back to the birth of the chain."}
{"question": "How does the protocol handle an assertion with older siblings, where one sibling is considered correct?", "answer": "If two assertions are siblings and the older sibling is correct, then the younger sibling is considered incorrect, even if everything else in the younger sibling is true."}
{"question": "What happens to a proposed assertion after its deadline has passed, and how does this relate to confirmed assertions in the rollup chain?", "answer": "After an assertion's deadline has passed, it can be confirmed or rejected by the parent chain contracts; confirmed assertions are fully accepted and recorded, while newer proposed assertions await confirmation or rejection until their deadlines run out."}
{"question": "How do proposed assertions interact with each other in the protocol?", "answer": "Proposed assertions can build on earlier proposed assertions, allowing validators to continue proposing without waiting for confirmation of the previous one."}
{"question": "What happens to most proposed assertions in the protocol?", "answer": "Normally, all of the proposed assertions will be valid and eventually accepted."}
{"question": "Why is the example of the chain state with malicious validators considered contrived?", "answer": "The example is designed to illustrate a variety of cases that can come up in the protocol, all combined into a single scenario."}
{"question": "What happens to Assertion 105 after its predecessor, Assertion 104, is rejected?", "answer": "Assertion 105 is rejected because its predecessor was rejected."}
{"question": "Why will Assertion 111 inevitably be rejected?", "answer": "Assertion 111 will inevitably be rejected because its predecessor, Assertion 104, has already been rejected."}
{"question": "What is the status of Assertions 107 and 108 if Assertion 106 is rejected?", "answer": "Assertions 107 and 108 will be automatically rejected too if Assertion 106 is rejected."}
{"question": "What happens to bonds when a bonder loses a challenge in the Arbitrum protocol?", "answer": "The bonds will be confiscated by the Arbitrum parent chain contracts."}
{"question": "Can a single bond cover multiple assertions in the Nitro chains?", "answer": "Yes, a single bond can cover a chain of assertions."}
{"question": "What is required for a validator to create a new assertion in the Arbitrum protocol?", "answer": "The validator must be a bonder and already bonded on the predecessor of the new assertion they are creating."}
{"question": "What happens to your bond when you lose a challenge?", "answer": "Your bond is removed from all assertions and you forfeit your bonded funds."}
{"question": "Under what conditions can an unresolved assertion be confirmed?", "answer": "An unresolved assertion can be confirmed if the assertion's predecessor is the latest confirmed assertion, and the assertion's deadline has passed."}
{"question": "Can you unbond from an assertion once you are bonded on it?", "answer": "No, once you are bonded on an assertion, there is no way to unbond. You are committed to that assertion."}
{"question": "Under what conditions can an unresolved assertion be rejected?", "answer": "An unresolved assertion can be rejected if its predecessor has been rejected or if it has a sibling that has been confirmed."}
{"question": "What happens when two bonders disagree about which assertion is correct after the first unresolved assertion's deadline has passed?", "answer": "It's time for a challenge to resolve the disagreement, as at least one bonder is bonded on each of the conflicting assertions with the same predecessor."}
{"question": "What type of user activity is delayed during a dispute in the BoLD system, and what is the maximum delay in the common case?", "answer": "The only delay experienced by users is for their L2 to L1 messages (or 'withdrawals'), which will be delayed by no more than one challenge period in the common case."}
{"question": "What is the role of Arbitrum full nodes in relation to the Rollup protocol?", "answer": "Arbitrum full nodes normally don't worry about the Rollup protocol and simply treat their Arbitrum chain as a mechanism that feeds inbox messages to the State Transition Function."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of validators in the context of Arbitrum nodes?", "answer": "Validators watch the progress of the Rollup protocol and participate in it to advance the state of the chain securely."}
{"question": "Are all nodes required to participate in the Rollup protocol, or can they choose to ignore it?", "answer": "Not all nodes are required to participate in the Rollup protocol; a node can ignore it and simply compute for itself the correct behavior based on inbox messages."}
{"question": "What is the primary goal of the active validator strategy in the Arbitrum One chain?", "answer": "The primary goal of the active validator strategy is to advance the state of the chain by proposing new assertions."}
{"question": "How does the defensive validator strategy respond when an incorrect assertion is proposed in the Rollup protocol?", "answer": "The defensive validator strategy intervenes by posting a correct assertion or staking on a correct assertion that another party has posted."}
{"question": "What is the key assumption underlying the watchtower validator strategy, and how does it differ from the defensive validator strategy?", "answer": "The watchtower validator strategy assumes that other parties who are willing to bond will intervene to defend against dishonest assertions, whereas the defensive validator strategy itself bonds to defend against such assertions."}
{"question": "Who can perform validation on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "Anyone can perform validation on Arbitrum One."}
{"question": "Why would parties choose to validate a chain on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "Parties may choose to validate a chain for several reasons, including being paid for their work, protecting significant assets at stake, or simply to protect their own interests."}
{"question": "Do ordinary users need to validate on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "No, ordinary users do not need to validate on Arbitrum One, and it is expected that the vast majority of users won't."}
{"question": "How does Nitro resolve the tension between execution and proving in a rollup system?", "answer": "Nitro resolves this tension by using the same source code for both execution and proving, but compiling it to different targets for the two cases."}
{"question": "What format is used for proving in Nitro, and how is it generated?", "answer": "The format used for proving in Nitro is WAVM, which is generated by compiling the Go code to WebAssembly (WASM) and then transforming it through a simple stage."}
{"question": "What are the main differences between WAVM and WASM in the context of Nitro?", "answer": "WAVM differs from WASM in three main ways: it removes some WASM features that the Go compiler does not generate, and the transformation phase verifies that these features are not present."}
{"question": "What are the main differences between WAVM and wasm?", "answer": "WAVM differs from wasm in three main ways: removal of unused features, restriction of certain features, and addition of new opcodes for environment interaction."}
{"question": "Why does WAVM replace floating-point instructions with calls to the Berkeley SoftFloat library?", "answer": "To reduce the risk of floating-point incompatibilities between architectures, as the core Nitro functions never use floating-point but the Go runtime does."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of adding new opcodes to WAVM to enable interaction with the environment?", "answer": "The new opcodes allow WAVM code to read and write the chain's global state, get the next message from the chain's inbox, or signal a successful end to execute the State Transition Function."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `ReadPreImage` instruction in the context of Ethereum's state tree format?", "answer": "The `ReadPreImage` instruction allows the State Transition Function (STF) to recover the contents of a tree node given its hash, relying on the fact that the full contents of the tree are publicly known and that nodes in the Ethereum state tree will always be smaller than the upper bound on preimage size."}
{"question": "How does the `ReadPreImage` instruction ensure safety when used to fetch the contents of recent headers?", "answer": "The `ReadPreImage` instruction is safe when used to fetch the contents of recent headers because the block headers are publicly known and have bounded size, allowing for efficient verification of the supplied value."}
{"question": "What is the limitation on the size of the preimage that can be used with the `ReadPreImage` instruction?", "answer": "The size of the preimage is known to be less than a fixed upper bound of about 110 kbytes, ensuring that the `ReadPreImage` instruction can only be used in a context where the preimage is publicly known and its size is bounded."}
{"question": "What is the primary use of `ReadPreImage` in relation to block headers?", "answer": "To fetch the contents of recent headers, given the header hash."}
{"question": "Why is it safe to use `ReadPreImage` to fetch the contents of block headers?", "answer": "Because the block headers are publicly known and have bounded size."}
{"question": "What design concept is the 'hash oracle trick' based on, where a Merkle hash of a data structure is stored?", "answer": "The original design of relying on protocol participants to store the full structure and support fetch-by-hash of the contents."}
{"question": "What is the primary role of the Sequencer in the Arbitrum network?", "answer": "The Sequencer is responsible for efficiently ordering and processing transactions, providing users with fast confirmations while maintaining the security and integrity of the network."}
{"question": "How does the Sequencer optimize costs and performance in Arbitrum?", "answer": "The Sequencer optimizes costs and performance by batching, compressing, and posting transaction data to the parent chain, reducing data size and optimizing the parent chain pricing model."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the Censorship Timeout feature in Arbitrum?", "answer": "The Censorship Timeout feature aims to limit the negative effects of prolonged sequencer censorship and/or unexpected sequencer outages, ensuring that transactions are confirmed securely and reliably."}
{"question": "What is the role of the Sequencer within the Arbitrum ecosystem?", "answer": "The Sequencer enhances transaction throughput, reduces latency, and maintains a fair and decentralized network."}
{"question": "How does the Sequencer communicate the transaction sequence to nodes and clients?", "answer": "The Sequencer communicates the transaction sequence through two primary channels: Real-Time Sequencer Feed and Batches Posted on the Parent Chain."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the Real-Time Sequencer Feed?", "answer": "The Real-Time Sequencer Feed allows nodes and clients to receive immediate notifications of sequenced transactions, enabling them to process transactions without delay."}
{"question": "What is the primary purpose of subscribing to the real-time feed provided by the Sequencer?", "answer": "To receive immediate notifications about newly sequenced transactions and their ordering, process transactions promptly, and benefit from soft finality."}
{"question": "How does the concept of 'soft finality' relate to the trust model in the context of the Sequencer's real-time feed?", "answer": "Soft finality refers to the preliminary confirmation of transactions based on the Sequencer's real-time feed, which depends on the Sequencer operating honestly and without significant downtime."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between the Sequencer's soft finality and the ultimate security and finality established by the parent chain?", "answer": "While the real-time feed provides quick updates, ultimate security and finality are established once transactions are posted to and finalized on the parent chain, ensuring eventual consistency with the parent chain."}
{"question": "What is the primary function of the Sequencer Feed in the Arbitrum ecosystem?", "answer": "The Sequencer Feed serves several vital functions, including state synchronization, application development, and ecosystem transparency."}
{"question": "What are some limitations of relying on the Sequencer Feed for real-time transaction visibility?", "answer": "Limitations include reliance on Sequencer availability, provisional nature of soft finality, and security implications for high-stakes transactions."}
{"question": "How should developers and users approach designing applications that interact with the Sequencer Feed?", "answer": "Developers and users should design their applications with consideration of the trade-off between speed and certainty, choosing an approach that balances these factors based on their specific requirements."}
{"question": "What types of transactions does the Sequencer feed incorporate from the parent chain?", "answer": "The Sequencer feed incorporates child chain (L2) transactions submitted on the parent chain (L1), including child chain messages and retryable transactions."}
{"question": "Why does the Sequencer wait for transactions to be finalized on the Ethereum chain before adding them to the feed?", "answer": "The Sequencer waits for transactions to be finalized to mitigate the risk of child chain reorganization if a transaction fails to finalize on the parent chain."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of Batch-Posting in the operation of the Sequencer within the Arbitrum network?", "answer": "Batch-Posting collects multiple child chain transactions, organizes them into batches, compresses the data, and sends these batches to the Sequencer Inbox Contract on the parent chain to securely record transactions while optimizing for cost and performance."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of batching in the Batch-Posting process?", "answer": "The purpose of batching is to group incoming transactions into batches for efficient processing and posting, optimizing for both cost efficiency and timely transaction inclusion."}
{"question": "How does the Sequencer compress transaction data in the Batch-Posting process?", "answer": "The methods used to compress transaction data are not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that compression minimizes the amount of data that needs to be posted on the parent chain, thereby reducing costs."}
{"question": "What is the role of the Sequencer Inbox Contract in the Batch-Posting process?", "answer": "The Sequencer Inbox Contract is used to securely and reliably record transactions by submitting compressed batches to it on the parent chain."}
{"question": "What triggers batch formation in the Sequencer?", "answer": "Batch formation occurs when accumulated transactions reach a predefined size limit or when the maximum time threshold since the last posted batch is reached."}
{"question": "How does the Sequencer prepare batches for posting to the parent chain?", "answer": "The Sequencer aggregates buffered transactions into a single batch, includes necessary metadata, and prepares the batch for compression to minimize data size before posting."}
{"question": "What compression algorithm is used by Arbitrum to optimize transaction batch data and reduce parent chain posting costs?", "answer": "Arbitrum uses the Brotli compression algorithm due to its high compression ratio and efficiency."}
{"question": "What is the range of the compression level parameter in the Brotli algorithm?", "answer": "0 to 11"}
{"question": "How does the compression level affect the balance between compression efficiency and computational cost?", "answer": "Higher levels result in greater size reduction, but require more processing power and time."}
{"question": "What happens to the compression level on Arbitrum when the buffer becomes overloaded with overdue batches?", "answer": "The compression level decreases to prioritize speed over compression efficiency, enabling faster processing and transmitting pending batches."}
{"question": "What is the primary role of the Batch Poster in the transaction process?", "answer": "The Batch Poster is responsible for submitting the compressed transaction batches to the Sequencer Inbox Contract on the parent chain."}
{"question": "How does the Sequencer utilize blob transactions when the parent chain supports EIP-4844?", "answer": "The Sequencer uses the `addSequencerL2BatchFromBlobs` function of the Sequencer Inbox Contract, including batch data as blobs to optimize for scalability and reduce gas costs."}
{"question": "What are the benefits of using blobs instead of calldata for transaction batches?", "answer": "Using blobs allows for cost efficiency by reducing gas costs and enhances scalability by allowing the network to handle large volumes of transactions."}
{"question": "What is the alternative approach used by the Sequencer when the Blob Base Fee is significantly high or blob space is constrained?", "answer": "The Sequencer uses calldata instead of blobs."}
{"question": "How does the Sequencer determine whether to use calldata or blobs for batch posting?", "answer": "The Sequencer dynamically assesses the cost-effectiveness based on current gas prices and blob fees."}
{"question": "What is achieved by transactions once batches are posted to the parent chain?", "answer": "Transactions achieve parent-chain-level finality, secured by the Parent chain's consensus mechanism."}
{"question": "What is finality in the context of blockchain systems, particularly in Arbitrum's Nitro architecture?", "answer": "Finality refers to the point at which a transaction becomes irreversible and permanently included in the blockchain's ledger."}
{"question": "What are the two levels of finality offered by Arbitrum, and how do they differ from each other?", "answer": "Arbitrum offers soft finality, which provides immediate but provisional transaction confirmations through the Sequencer's real-time feed, and hard finality, which occurs when transactions are included in batches posted to and finalized on the parent chain, providing strong security assurances."}
{"question": "What are the key characteristics and advantages of soft finality in the Arbitrum network?", "answer": "Soft finality is characterized by immediate confirmation, provisional assurance, and high performance, offering advantages such as low latency, optimized speed, and improved user experience."}
{"question": "What are the limitations of soft finality in terms of security and trust?", "answer": "Soft finality relies on the Sequencer's honesty, has potential for reordering, and is not suitable for high-value transactions requiring strong security guarantees."}
{"question": "What are the key characteristics and advantages of hard finality?", "answer": "Hard finality provides strong security guarantees, irreversibility, data availability, maximum security, trust minimization, and is suitable for high-value transactions."}
{"question": "What are the limitations of achieving hard finality in terms of time and cost?", "answer": "Achieving hard finality takes longer due to parent chain processing times and incurs fees that may affect transaction costs, resulting in higher latency and cost considerations."}
{"question": "What are the key trust assumptions associated with the Soft Finality Trust Model?", "answer": "Users must trust that the Sequencer operates honestly, sequences transactions correctly, and remains available."}
{"question": "In what scenarios should developers rely on Hard Finality for their applications?", "answer": "Developers should rely on Hard Finality for high-value transactions, regulatory compliance, and centralized exchanges where security is critical."}
{"question": "What is the main difference between the Soft Finality Trust Model and the Hard Finality Trust Model in terms of trust reliance?", "answer": "The Soft Finality Trust Model relies on the Sequencer, while the Hard Finality Trust Model relies on the consensus and integrity of the parent chain."}
{"question": "What is the primary purpose of the Censorship Timeout feature in Arbitrum BoLD?", "answer": "To limit the negative effects of prolonged sequencer censorship and/or unexpected sequencer outages."}
{"question": "How does the Censorship Timeout feature improve the security of chains settling to Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova?", "answer": "By decreasing the force inclusion threshold when unexpected delays in delayed message inclusion occur due to censorship or sequencer outage, enabling entities to make moves without a 24 hour delay-per-move."}
{"question": "What would be the delay in challenge resolution if a challenge takes 50 sequential moves to resolve without the Censorship Timeout feature?", "answer": "50 days, calculated as (24 hours) * number of moves for a challenge."}
{"question": "What is the force inclusion window in the context of Arbitrum chains?", "answer": "The lesser of either the `delayBuffer` and `delayBlocks`, where `delayBlocks` is a constant set to 24 hours."}
{"question": "How does the `delayBuffer` value change when the sequencer is offline or censoring transactions, and what is the threshold for this behavior on Arbitrum One?", "answer": "The `delayBuffer` value decrements by the difference between a delayed message's delay beyond the `threshold`, and it has been delayed. The threshold on Arbitrum One is 30 minutes."}
{"question": "What are the proposed initial parameter values for the Censorship Timeout feature on Arbitrum One, including `delay buffer`, `threshold`, and `replenish rate`?", "answer": "`delay buffer` = 14400 L1 Ethereum blocks (2 days), `threshold` = 150 L1 Ethereum blocks (30 minutes), and `replenish rate` = 5%."}
{"question": "What is Arbitrum's long-term vision for its Sequencer?", "answer": "To transition from a centralized Sequencer to a decentralized, fair sequencing model."}
{"question": "How does the proposed decentralized sequencing model ensure fairness and reduce manipulation?", "answer": "By requiring a supermajority consensus among a committee of servers or validators, distributing sequencing power among multiple honest participants."}
{"question": "What benefits does the decentralized sequencing approach provide in terms of blockchain principles?", "answer": "Enhanced security, transparency, and decentralization, while mitigating risks of front-running or censorship."}

{"question": "On which Arbitrum chain will Timeboost be rolled out first for testing?", "answer": "Arbitrum Sepolia"}
{"question": "What are the benefits of the current ordering policy, and what are its drawbacks?", "answer": "The current ordering policy has benefits such as great UX and protection from harmful types of MEV, but its drawbacks include wasteful investment in hardware and spamming to win latency races, which negatively strains the network and leads to congestion."}
{"question": "How does Timeboost introduce a new transaction ordering policy, and what components does it add to an Arbitrum chain's infrastructure?", "answer": "Timeboost introduces a sealed-bid second-price auction and a new express lane at an Arbitrum chain's sequencer, allowing valid transactions to be sequenced immediately with no delay, while other transactions experience a nominal delay."}
{"question": "Who are the target groups for Timeboost, and how can they benefit from this optional feature?", "answer": "Timeboost is aimed at two types of groups: (1) chain owners and their ecosystems, who can capture additional revenue from MEV, and (2) sophisticated on-chain actors and searchers, who can spend resources on buying rights for the express lane instead of winning latency races."}
{"question": "What type of sequencer setups will Timeboost work with?", "answer": "Timeboost will work with both centralized and decentralized sequencer setups."}
{"question": "Where can the specification for a centralized sequencer be found?", "answer": "The specification for a centralized sequencer can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design"}
{"question": "Why was a proposal made to the Arbitrum DAO regarding Timeboost?", "answer": "A proposal was made to the Arbitrum DAO to adopt Timeboost, allowing it to be delivered to market sooner, rather than waiting for the completion of the design with a decentralized sequencer setup."}
{"question": "Why do Arbitrum chains need Timeboost?", "answer": "Arbitrum chains need Timeboost because their current First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) ordering policy has downsides, such as incentivizing searchers to participate in latency races, contributing to congestion, and not returning any available MEV to the chain owner or applications."}
{"question": "What are the limitations of the FCFS ordering policy on Arbitrum chains?", "answer": "The limitations of FCFS include incentivizing searchers to invest in off-chain hardware for latency races, generating spam and stress on chain infrastructure, and not returning any captured MEV to the chain owner or applications."}
{"question": "How will Timeboost affect the user experience on Arbitrum chains?", "answer": "Timeboost preserves the great UX that Arbitrum chains are known for, with default block times remaining at 250ms, but some transactions not in the express lane may be delayed to the next block."}
{"question": "How does Timeboost protect users from harmful types of MEV?", "answer": "Timeboost only grants the auction winner a temporary time advantage, without the power to view or reorder incoming transactions, and the transactions mempool remains private, protecting users from front-running and sandwich attacks."}
{"question": "What new opportunity does Timeboost provide for chain owners?", "answer": "Timeboost unlocks a new value accrual path for chain owners, allowing them to capture a portion of the available MEV on their chain that would have otherwise gone entirely to searchers."}
{"question": "How can Timeboost help reduce spam and congestion on a network?", "answer": "By introducing the ability to purchase a time advantage through the Timeboost auction, rational actors will spend on auctions instead of investing in hardware or infrastructure to win latency races, reducing FCFS MEV-driven spam on the network."}
{"question": "What is Timeboost and what role does it play in an Arbitrum chain?", "answer": "Timeboost is a transaction ordering policy, a set of rules that the sequencer of an Arbitrum chain follows when ordering transactions submitted by users."}
{"question": "How does the express lane component of Timeboost work?", "answer": "The express lane allows valid transactions to be sequenced as soon as the sequencer receives them for a given round, determined by an off-chain auction that manages the controller of the express lane."}
{"question": "What happens to transactions not in the express lane and how does it affect their sequencing?", "answer": "Transactions not in the express lane are subject to a default 200-millisecond artificial delay to their arrival timestamp before their transaction is sequenced, potentially delaying them to the next block."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `timeboost_sendExpressLaneTransaction` endpoint in the sequencer?", "answer": "The purpose of the `timeboost_sendExpressLaneTransaction` endpoint is to allow transactions to be sequenced immediately by the sequencer, hence the name 'express lane'."}
{"question": "How do transactions from the express and non-express lanes ultimately get processed?", "answer": "Transactions from both the express and non-express lanes are eventually sequenced into a single, ordered stream of transactions for node operators to produce an assertion and later post the data to a data availability layer."}
{"question": "What factors determine the value of the express lane?", "answer": "The value of the express lane is determined by the sum of how much MEV the express lane controller predicts they can extract during the upcoming round, plus the amount of MEV extracted by the express lane controller while they are in control."}
{"question": "What type of auction is used to determine control of the express lane in each round?", "answer": "A sealed-bid, second-price auction"}
{"question": "How long before the beginning of a round does the auction for that round close?", "answer": "`auctionClosingSeconds` (default: 15) seconds"}
{"question": "What happens during the 15 seconds between when bids are no longer accepted and when the new round begins?", "answer": "The autonomous auctioneer verifies all bids, determines the winner, and makes a call to the on-chain auction contract to formally resolve the auction"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of depositing funds into the Auction Contract before placing a bid?", "answer": "To ensure that bidders have sufficient funds to cover their bids, and to allow for the auction contract to deduct the second-highest bid amount from the highest bidder's account."}
{"question": "How is the minimum reserve price updated in the Auction Contract, and what is its significance?", "answer": "The minimum reserve price can be updated by the chain owner at any time up to 30 seconds before the start of the next round. It sets a floor for the bids, ensuring that the auction participants know the reserve price before submitting their bids."}
{"question": "What happens to the funds of the highest bidder after the autonomous auctioneer determines the auction winner?", "answer": "The auction contract deducts the second-highest bid amount from the account of the highest bidder and transfers those funds to a beneficiary account designated by the chain owner."}
{"question": "What is the duration of time that the sequencer will honor the express lane privileges for transactions signed by the current round's express lane controller?", "answer": "60 seconds"}
{"question": "What is the minimum bid amount accepted by the auction contract for Timeboost auctions, denominated in `_biddingToken`?", "answer": "None, but it has a floor minimum of 0.001 WETH"}

{"question": "What is the impact of Timeboost on regular users in terms of transaction delay?", "answer": "A nominal 200ms delay, resulting in a total transaction time of approximately 450ms"}
{"question": "How can chain owners benefit from implementing Timeboost on their network?", "answer": "By setting up a Timeboost auction to collect bid proceeds in the same token used for gas and generating revenue for the chain"}
{"question": "What potential opportunities does Timeboost offer to searchers and arbitrageurs?", "answer": "The ability to purchase time advantages through auctions, potentially at a lower cost than investing in hardware, and the possibility of reselling express lane rights to other parties"}
{"question": "What is the impact of deploying and enabling/disabling Timeboost on a live Arbitrum chain?", "answer": "It will not halt or impact the chain but will instead influence the chain's transaction ordering policy."}
{"question": "Why should Arbitrum teams assess the applicability and use cases of Timeboost before deploying it?", "answer": "Because some Arbitrum chains may not have that much MEV (e.g., arbitrage) to begin with, and they should closely monitor the results and impacts on their chain's ecosystem over time."}
{"question": "What is the current status of Timeboost's auction contract and when can we expect it to be ready for mainnet?", "answer": "Timeboost's auction contract has completed a third-party audit and is rapidly approaching production readiness, with an expected on-chain Tally vote before the end of Q1 2025."}

{"question": "How do users submit their transactions using the delayed inbox contract to bypass the sequencer?", "answer": "Users can submit their transactions to the delayed inbox contract, which may be automatically picked up by the sequencer or can be forced to be included using the `forceInclude` function if not processed within 24 hours."}
{"question": "What happens if the sequencer does not process a transaction within 24 hours after it is submitted to the delayed inbox contract?", "answer": "Users have the option to call the `forceInclude` function on the sequencer inbox contract, ensuring that the sequencer picks up the transaction and includes it in the ordered transaction list."}
{"question": "How can users send a transaction to the delayed inbox instead of submitting it to the sequencer?", "answer": "By constructing their transaction and calling the `sendL2Message` function, passing the data of the serialized signed transaction as an argument."}
{"question": "What action can users take if the sequencer is not back online within 24 hours or decides to censor the transaction?", "answer": "Users can invoke the `forceInclusion` function on the SequencerInbox contract to ensure their transaction is included on the chain, bypassing the sequencer's role."}
{"question": "What class in the Arbitrum SDK simplifies the process of submitting transactions to the delayed inbox and what methods does it provide?", "answer": "The `InboxTools` class simplifies the process, providing methods such as `sendChildSignedTx` to send the transaction and `forceInclude` to ensure its inclusion, as well as helper methods like `signChildTx` for signing the transaction."}
{"question": "What is Arbitrum?", "answer": "Arbitrum is a technology suite designed to scale Ethereum, allowing users to do all things they do on Ethereum \u2014 use Web3 apps, deploy smart contracts, etc., but with cheaper and faster transactions."}
{"question": "Why does Ethereum need help from scaling solutions like Arbitrum?", "answer": "Ethereum needs help because it has a limited capacity of around 20-40 transactions per second (TPS), which can lead to high fees when the limit is reached and users compete for transaction inclusion."}
{"question": "What is the main limitation of Ethereum that Arbitrum aims to address?", "answer": "The main limitation of Ethereum is its low transaction per second (TPS) capacity, which can cause fees to go up when the network is congested."}
{"question": "Why does Ethereum have such low TPS?", "answer": "Ethereum's low TPS is a deliberate design decision to ensure that its nodes can come to consensus on the current state of things by processing every transaction in its history, while keeping it reasonably accessible for anyone to run an Ethereum node and validate the chain."}
{"question": "What is the main idea behind Arbitrum Rollup?", "answer": "The basic idea of Arbitrum Rollup is that it runs as a sub-module within Ethereum, where Ethereum nodes don't need to process every Arbitrum transaction, instead adopting an 'innocent until proven guilty' attitude and allowing disputes to be resolved on Layer 1."}
{"question": "How does Arbitrum Rollup resolve disputes and prevent fraud?", "answer": "If a violation occurs on Arbitrum, it can be disputed back on Layer 1, where fraud will be proven, the invalid claim disregarded, and the malicious party will be financially penalized."}
{"question": "Can we be absolutely sure that we'll be able to prove fraud if it is committed on Arbitrum?", "answer": "Yes, indeed we can be, as long as Ethereum itself is running securely and the data fed into an Arbitrum Rollup chain is posted directly on Ethereum."}
{"question": "Who does the work of checking for fraud and proving it on Arbitrum?", "answer": "The parties who move the Arbitrum chain state forward on L1, called validators, do this work, and anybody can become a validator by running the open source validator software and staking Ether when necessary."}
{"question": "What is required to become an Arbitrum validator?", "answer": "Becoming an Arbitrum validator requires no special permission, only that a user runs the open source validator software and stakes Ether when/if they need to take action."}
{"question": "And how exactly is \"fraud\" \"proven\"? Sounds complicated.", "answer": "In essence, if two validators disagree, only one of them (at most) can be telling the truth. In a dispute, the two validators play an interactive, call-and-response game in which they narrow down their dispute to a single computational step."}
{"question": "This dispute game obviously takes some time; does this impose any sort of delay on Arbitrum users' transactions?", "answer": "The only delay that's felt by a user is in \"withdrawing\" \u2014 moving their funds from Arbitrum back to Ethereum; if users are withdrawing directly from Arbitrum to Ethereum, they must typically wait 1 week before receiving their funds on L1."}
{"question": "Can users bypass the delay period when withdrawing funds from Arbitrum to Ethereum?", "answer": "Yes, users can bypass this delay period entirely by using a fast-application, likely for a small fee."}
{"question": "Is optimistic execution the primary reason why Arbitrum is able to offer low fees?", "answer": "Primarily, yes, this is the heart of where the savings come from."}
{"question": "How does Arbitrum alleviate the burden on L1 and reduce transaction costs for end users?", "answer": "Arbitrum transactions are submitted on the L1 in batches, which amortizes the overhead cost of interacting with the L1, and the transaction data is posted on L1 in compressed form."}

{"question": "Why do I need ETH to use the Arbitrum network?", "answer": "ETH is the currency used to pay gas fees on Arbitrum, and all Arbitrum transactions are powered by ETH."}
{"question": "Do I need to pay a tip or priority fee for my Arbitrum transactions?", "answer": "No priority fee is necessary for Arbitrum transactions; if a transaction does include a priority fee, it will be refunded to the transaction's origin address at the end of the execution."}
{"question": "How can I see the balance of ETH and other tokens in my wallet on Arbitrum?", "answer": "Ensure that you are connected to the appropriate Arbitrum chain in your wallet, such as MetaMask or OKX Wallet, by selecting the desired network via the 'networks' dropdown."}
{"question": "What happens if I send funds through the Arbitrum network to a wallet or exchange that doesn't support it?", "answer": "Unfortunately, nothing can be done to recover your funds, and you would need to contact the wallet/exchange support for help."}
{"question": "Does Arbitrum have a mempool?", "answer": "No, instead of a mempool, the Arbitrum Sequencer orders transactions on a first come, first served basis and inserts them into a queue based on the order they are received."}
{"question": "What is the difference between Arbitrum Rollup and Arbitrum AnyTrust?", "answer": "Arbitrum Rollup is an Optimistic Rollup protocol that is trustless and permissionless, whereas the details of Arbitrum AnyTrust are not specified in the provided text."}
{"question": "What is the trust assumption in Arbitrum AnyTrust and how does it affect the chain's safety?", "answer": "The trust assumption in Arbitrum AnyTrust is that at least K members of the Data Availability Committee (DAC) are honest, where K is a threshold value. If 19 out of 20 committee members and the Sequencer are malicious, they can break the chain's safety."}
{"question": "How does the AnyTrust chain operate when at least 19 of the 20 committee members are well-behaved?", "answer": "When at least 19 of the 20 committee members are well-behaved, the system operates without posting the L2 chain's data on L1, resulting in significantly lower fees for users."}
{"question": "How can I check the status of my cross-chain message on Arbitrum?", "answer": "You can check the status of your cross-chain message at https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/ by providing the transaction hash of the initiating transaction, which is either the L1 or L2 transaction hash depending on the type of message."}
{"question": "If there is a dispute, can my L2 transaction get reorged / thrown out / 'yeeted'?", "answer": "Nope; once an Arbitrum transaction is included on L1, there is no way it can be reorged (unless the L1 itself reorgs, of course)."}
{"question": "If there's a dispute, will my transaction get delayed?", "answer": "The only thing that a dispute can add delay to is the confirmation of L2-to-L1 messages. All other transactions continue to be processed, even while a dispute is still undergoing."}
{"question": "Are 'Sequencers' the same entities as 'Validators'? Can a centralized Sequencer act maliciously (e.g., steal all my money)?", "answer": "No and no!"}
{"question": "What is the role of the Sequencer in an Arbitrum Chain?", "answer": "The Sequencer is responsible for ordering transactions, but once it commits to an ordering, it has no say over what happens next."}
{"question": "Can a centralized Sequencer compromise the safety of an Arbitrum Rollup chain?", "answer": "No, a malicious or faulty Sequencer can cause annoyances such as reordering transactions or delaying a transaction's inclusion, but it cannot compromise the chain's safety."}
{"question": "What is more important for achieving trustlessness in an Arbitrum Rollup chain, decentralizing the Sequencer or decentralizing the Validators?", "answer": "Decentralizing the Validators is more important, as they are responsible for the safety of the chain, and a centralized Sequencer does not necessarily compromise the chain's trustlessness."}
{"question": "Why was one week chosen for Arbitrum One's dispute window?", "answer": "A week is expected to be more than enough time for validators to carry out an interactive dispute, assuming they don't encounter difficulty in getting their transactions included on L1."}

{"question": "Can I withdraw my funds from Arbitrum back to Ethereum without going through the Sequencer?", "answer": "Yes, it is possible to permissionlessly send a message from Ethereum to be executed on Arbitrum, while bypassing the Sequencer, by using the DelayedInbox contract and force-including the message after a certain amount of time has passed."}
{"question": "Can I withdraw funds that are in a contract from Arbitrum back to Ethereum without going through the Sequencer?", "answer": "Yes, you can execute any message, including a call to a contract, using the DelayedInbox contract and force-including the message after a certain amount of time has passed."}
{"question": "Are there any plans to reduce the time a transaction needs to wait before being able to be force-included from Ethereum into the Arbitrum chain, bypassing the sequencer?", "answer": "There are no active initiatives to lower the time, but the decision ultimately falls in the hands of the Arbitrum DAO, who has discussed the topic in their governance forum."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the mechanism that allows force-including transactions from Ethereum into the Arbitrum chain, bypassing the sequencer?", "answer": "The mechanism is intended to be used in very rare cases, especially when it is expected that the sequencer will not be operational again, so that users have a way of interacting with Arbitrum in a trustless way."}
{"question": "Why was 24 hours chosen as the time window for force-including transactions from Ethereum into the Arbitrum chain?", "answer": "24 hours was chosen because it provides a comfortable period of time for the team running the sequencer infrastructure to fix any bugs that may cause the sequencer to not work."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of decentralizing the sequencer in an Arbitrum chain?", "answer": "To address distrust of the sequencer, a centralized agent, by providing an alternative solution to reducing force-inclusion delay time."}
{"question": "What is the difference between an L2 block and an assertion in the context of Arbitrum?", "answer": "An L2 block is similar to an Ethereum block, generated by validator nodes for state transition, while an assertion is a distinctive block transmitted to L1 as a fingerprint of the Arbitrum chain's current state."}
{"question": "How are assertions in the Arbitrum chain confirmed on L1?", "answer": "Assertions are confirmed on L1 after a challenge period of approximately one week, during which other validators can challenge them if they discover discrepancies in the state hash, and once the challenge period elapses, the assertion is confirmed."}
{"question": "Why do Arbitrum chains enforce a speed limit?", "answer": "Arbitrum chains enforce a speed limit because if the speed of the chain increases too much, validators may not have enough computation power to process all transactions in a timely manner."}
{"question": "What happens when validators fall behind on validating transactions?", "answer": "When validators fall behind on validating transactions, it causes the chain to delay confirmations of its state."}
{"question": "What is the main constraint that Arbitrum chains have to take into account when setting the speed limit?", "answer": "The transaction lifecycle sets a limit that Arbitrum chains have to take into account, which includes validators executing each transaction, getting the status of the chain, and posting an assertion to Ethereum every certain amount of time."}

{"question": "How do I run a node?", "answer": "See instructions here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node"}
{"question": "How to verify the integrity of the Nitro database I currently have?", "answer": "We have an accumulator hash on all messages, which means that a message can't be added to the database without the previous message being correct. To confirm that everything's working properly, you could just make sure that it's syncing and that the latest block is consistent with other Arbitrum nodes; e.g., you could check it against Arbiscan (note that Arbiscan's search field doesn't support searching by block hash)."}
{"question": "How can I check if the node is running properly and diagnose the issue if it is not?", "answer": "We have trace-level logging RPC request implemented on our node. You could use it to log all requests and responses at the trace level."}
{"question": "Why do I need an L1 node to run an Arbitrum node?", "answer": "You need an L1 node to run an Arbitrum node because the Arbitrum node reads transactions from batches that were previously posted on L1 and have been executed, and it also waits for the L1 batch to be posted to change the state based on the L1 batched transactions if necessary."}
{"question": "Can I run an Arbitrum node in p2p mode?", "answer": "No, you cannot run an Arbitrum node in p2p mode because Arbitrum doesn't have a consensus mechanism and nodes do not need to peer up and sync with each other."}
{"question": "How do I read messages from the Sequencer feed?", "answer": "You can read messages from the Sequencer feed by running an Arbitrum relay locally as a Feed Relay, which lets you subscribe to the Sequencer feed for real-time data."}
{"question": "How do I run a node locally for development?", "answer": "To run a node locally for development, follow the instructions at https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/local-dev-node, or compile directly and run without docker by following the steps in How to build Nitro locally."}
{"question": "Is there any way to retrieve pre-Nitro archive data from a Nitro node?", "answer": "No, it is not possible for a nitro node to query archive information contained in classic blocks right away. To do that, you need to also run a classic node and set the parameter \u2014node.rpc.classic-redirect=your-classic-node-RPC."}
{"question": "How can I verify that my node is syncing at a desirable speed?", "answer": "To verify your node's syncing speed, check the minimum hardware requirements at https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#minimum-hardware-configuration, and also verify your network and disk speed, ensuring the L1 node is running correctly."}
{"question": "How can I verify that my node is fully synced?", "answer": "You can make an `eth_syncing` RPC call to your node. When a nitro node is fully synced, `eth_syncing` returns the value `false`. If the node is still syncing, it returns a map of values to help understand why."}
{"question": "Is there an alternative to Docker when running a node?", "answer": "Yes, you can try to compile the code directly by following the steps described in the guide on building Nitro locally, although running via Docker is recommended."}
{"question": "What are the minimum hardware requirements to run a full node?", "answer": "The minimum hardware configuration can be found in the section on running a full node, which outlines the necessary specifications for successfully operating a node."}
{"question": "How can I synchronize a new node with an existing fully synced node?", "answer": "You can copy the database (the `.arbitrum` directory) from the fully synced node to the same database folder of the new node after a clean shutdown."}
{"question": "Why do I sometimes get incorrect data, such as the zero address as the sender, when querying Classic transactions from a Nitro node?", "answer": "Some old Nitro genesis database snapshots didn't properly set the retry sender for Classic blocks, resulting in incorrect data."}
{"question": "What can I do to access accurate information about Classic transactions on a Nitro node?", "answer": "You can either resync your nitro node with one of the current snapshots or run a Classic node along with your nitro node and configure a redirection for requests to Classic blocks."}
{"question": "What are the minimum hardware requirements to run an Orbit node?", "answer": "8-16 GB of RAM, 2-4 core CPU, and storage that depends on the Orbit chain and its traffic overtime"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `--parent-chain.connection.url` argument in running an Orbit node?", "answer": "To provide a standard RPC endpoint for an EVM node, whether self-hosted or obtained from a node service provider"}
{"question": "What are the required parameters for the child chain in the Arbitrum Orbit context?", "answer": "`chain.info-json` and `chain.name`, where `chain.info-json` is a JSON string containing required information about the Orbit chain"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `--chain.name` flag?", "answer": "The `--chain.name` flag is used to specify the chain name, which must match the chain name used in `--chain.info-json`."}
{"question": "When is the `--execution.forwarding-target` flag required?", "answer": "The `--execution.forwarding-target` flag is required when running a regular full node (not sequencer) to specify the Sequencer node endpoint URL."}
{"question": "What flags are needed to enable AnyTrust chains?", "answer": "To enable AnyTrust chains, you need to add the `--node.data-availability.enable`, `--node.data-availability.rest-aggregator.enable`, and either `--node.data-availability.rest-aggregator.urls` or `--node.data-availability.rest-aggregator.online-url-list` flags."}
{"question": "What is the port number for the RPC/http protocol in Arbitrum?", "answer": "8547"}
{"question": "How can you enable the RPC/websocket protocol and specify its port and address when running a Docker image?", "answer": "Use flags --ws.port=8548, --ws.addr=0.0.0.0, and --ws.origins=*"}

{"question": "What is the purpose of the `--init.prune` flag and what are its possible values?", "answer": "The `--init.prune` flag prunes the database before starting the node, and its possible values are 'full' or 'validator'."}
{"question": "How does the `--node.batch-poster.post-4844-blobs` flag affect the posting of transaction data to L1 Ethereum?", "answer": "The `--node.batch-poster.post-4844-blobs` flag enables or disables the posting of transaction data using Blobs to L1 Ethereum. If set to `true`, the batch poster will use blobs when the parent chain supports EIP4844 blobs and calldata is more expensive."}
{"question": "What is the function of the `--init.then-quit` flag in conjunction with other `--init.*` parameters?", "answer": "The `--init.then-quit` flag allows any `--init.*` parameters to complete, and then the node will automatically quit, making it easier to script tasks like database backups after initialization processes finish."}

{"question": "What is Arbitrum?", "answer": "Arbitrum is a technology suite designed to scale Ethereum, allowing users to do all things they do on Ethereum \u2014 use Web3 apps, deploy smart contracts, etc., but with cheaper and faster transactions."}
{"question": "Why does Ethereum need help from Arbitrum?", "answer": "Ethereum needs help because it is limited to about 20-40 transactions per second (TPS), which causes fees to go up when the limit is reached, and users are forced to compete against each other for their transactions to be included."}
{"question": "What is the main limitation of Ethereum that Arbitrum aims to address?", "answer": "The main limitation of Ethereum is its low transaction per second (TPS) rate, which is around 20-40 TPS, and this limitation leads to high fees when the network is congested."}
{"question": "Why does Ethereum have such low TPS?", "answer": "Ethereum has low TPS due to its design requirement that every node processes every transaction in its history, which makes it difficult to increase transaction throughput without compromising decentralization."}
{"question": "What is the main goal of Ethereum's design?", "answer": "The main goal of Ethereum's design is to be an open, decentralized, peer-to-peer system that is reasonably accessible for anyone to run a node and validate the chain for themselves."}
{"question": "How does Arbitrum Rollup fix Ethereum's low TPS issue?", "answer": "Arbitrum Rollup fixes this by allowing Ethereum nodes to 'optimistically assume' activity on Arbitrum is following the proper rules, without requiring every node to process every Arbitrum transaction, and instead resolving disputes back on Layer 1 if a violation occurs."}
{"question": "Can we be absolutely sure that we'll be able to prove fraud if it is committed on Arbitrum?", "answer": "Yes, indeed we can be, as long as Ethereum itself is running securely, and the data fed into an Arbitrum Rollup chain is posted directly on Ethereum."}
{"question": "Who does the work of checking for fraud and proving it on Arbitrum?", "answer": "The parties who move the Arbitrum chain state forward on L1, called validators, do this work, and anybody can become a validator by running the open source validator software and staking Ether when necessary."}
{"question": "What is required to become an Arbitrum validator?", "answer": "Becoming an Arbitrum validator requires no special permission, only that a user runs the open source validator software and stakes Ether when/if they need to take action."}
{"question": "And how exactly is \u201cfraud\u201d \u201cproven\u201d? Sounds complicated.", "answer": "In essence, if two validators disagree, only one of them (at most) can be telling the truth. In a dispute, the two validators play an interactive, call-and-response game in which they narrow down their dispute to a single computational step."}
{"question": "This dispute game obviously takes some time; does this impose any sort of delay on Arbitrum users' transactions?", "answer": "The only delay that's felt by a user is in 'withdrawing' \u2014 moving their funds from Arbitrum back to Ethereum; if users are withdrawing directly from Arbitrum to Ethereum, they must typically wait 1 week before receiving their funds on L1."}
{"question": "Can users bypass the delay period when withdrawing funds from Arbitrum to Ethereum?", "answer": "Yes, users can bypass this delay period entirely by using a fast-application, likely for a small fee."}
{"question": "Is the 'optimistic execution' part of Arbitrum the reason for its low fees?", "answer": "Primarily, yes, this is the heart of where the savings come from, although there are other factors that contribute to lower transaction costs for end users."}
{"question": "How does Arbitrum reduce the burden on L1 and translate to lower transaction costs for end users?", "answer": "Arbitrum transactions are submitted on the L1 in batches, which amortizes the overhead cost of interacting with the L1, and the transaction data is posted on L1 in compressed form, minimizing the transaction's L1 footprint."}
{"question": "What is the user experience like when using Arbitrum compared to Ethereum?", "answer": "The experience of using Arbitrum is very similar to using Ethereum, with users able to use their favorite Ethereum wallets and developers able to build and deploy contracts with familiar Ethereum libraries and tooling, but with the added benefits of being much cheaper and faster."}
{"question": "Can builders do more on Arbitrum than they can on Ethereum?", "answer": "Yes, the latest version of the Arbitrum tech stack adds powerful new features, such as writing highly performant smart contracts in programming languages like Rust, C++, and more."}
{"question": "Is Arbitrum Rollup an ideal solution that solves all scaling problems?", "answer": "No, while Arbitrum Rollup is a significant improvement, decentralization comes at a price, and not all applications or users may want or need to pay that price, making other tools in the Arbitrum suite more suitable for different use-cases."}
{"question": "What is the core technology used by Arbitrum to achieve Ethereum compatibility?", "answer": "Arbitrum uses a fork of Geth, the most widely used Ethereum implementation, with modifications to transform it into a trustless layer 2, which is referred to as Nitro."}
{"question": "What is an AnyTrust chain and how does it differ from a Rollup chain?", "answer": "An AnyTrust chain is similar to a Rollup chain but manages data off-chain, offering lower fees, and has a security assumption that at least 2 committee members are honest."}
{"question": "Are there multiple Arbitrum chains available?", "answer": "Yes, there are multiple Arbitrum chains, including Arbitrum One and Nova on Ethereum mainnet, as well as various L3 (Orbit) chains on top of these and other L2s."}
{"question": "How can developers utilize Arbitrum chains for their applications?", "answer": "Developers can launch their own Arbitrum chains as an L2 chain on top of Ethereum or run them on top of an EVM L2 chain, allowing for flexibility and customization in their application development."}
{"question": "What type of chains can developers launch on top of Ethereum using Arbitrum?", "answer": "Developers can launch their own L2 chains"}

{"question": "Who makes decisions about the future of Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova?", "answer": "The Governance system"}
{"question": "What is the Arbitrum suite and what does it provide?", "answer": "The Arbitrum suite is a collection of Ethereum scaling solutions that make it easy to build and use decentralized applications, providing protocols, chains, services, and SDKs that power the Arbitrum ecosystem."}
{"question": "What are the different components of the Arbitrum suite and their functions?", "answer": "The Arbitrum suite includes various components such as Arbitrum Rollup, Arbitrum AnyTrust, Arbitrum Nitro, Arbitrum nodes, Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, Arbitrum bridge, Arbitrum Orbit, and Arbitrum Stylus, each serving distinct purposes like scaling Ethereum smart contracts, providing node software, public chains, bridging services, and more."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of Arbitrum Stylus in the Arbitrum ecosystem?", "answer": "Arbitrum Stylus allows users to write EVM-compatible smart contracts in Rust and any other language that compiles to Wasm."}
{"question": "How do users interact with the Arbitrum platform?", "answer": "Users interact with Arbitrum either through the Arbitrum bridge or by using dApps that have been deployed to an Arbitrum chain."}
{"question": "What resources are available for developers building Arbitrum dApps?", "answer": "Developers can use resources such as 'A gentle introduction to Arbitrum', 'Quickstart (Solidity)', and 'Quickstart (Rust)' to build and deploy smart contracts to an Arbitrum chain."}
{"question": "What options are available for node runners who want to support the Arbitrum ecosystem?", "answer": "Node runners can either run a full node to access Arbitrum chains without connecting to a third-party node, or configure a Data Availability Committee to support the ecosystem."}
